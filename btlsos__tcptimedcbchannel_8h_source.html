//@PURPOSE: Provide timed stream-based communication channel over TCP sockets.
//
//@CLASSES:
//  btlsos::TcpTimedCbChannel: non-blocking channel over TCP/IPv4 sockets
//
//@SEE_ALSO:  btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor btlsos_tcptimedcbconnector
//
//@SEE_ALSO:  btlsos_tcpcbchannel btlso_streamsocket
//
//@SEE_ALSO:  btlsc_timedcbchannel btlsc_timedchannel
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a non-blocking communication channel
// over TCP/IPv4 sockets, &#39;btlsos::TcpTimedCbChannel&#39;, that adheres to
// &#39;btlsc::TimedCbChannel&#39; protocol.  Following the protocol, both timed and
// non-timed operations are supported.  The channel uses user-installed timer
// event manager(s) to monitor an underlying socket for incoming events; two
// event managers can be installed in order to monitor for read and write
// events in different event managers.
//
// This channel uses a user-provided stream socket for IPv4 address family.
// Any concrete implementation that provides socket-like primitives is allowed.
// Common paradigms of acceptor and connector that produce channels directly is
// implemented (in other components) for both user convenience and completeness
// of the framework (see &#39;btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor&#39; and
// &#39;btlsos_tcptimedcbconnector&#39; components).
//
///Thread Safety
///-------------
// Generally speaking, this channel is *not* *thread-safe*, meaning that any
// operation can not be called on *distinct instances* from different threads
// without any side-effects.  Thread-safety of this channel depends on whether
// or not given event manager(s), stream socket implementation, and memory
// allocator is *thread enabled (meaning that any operation can be invoked on
// the same instance from different threads).  If two channels share the same
// event manager, memory manager, and stream socket, then this two instances
// are thread safe if and only if the user-installed components are thread
// enabled.
//
///Performance
///-----------
// This channel is optimized for timed homogeneous operations, where
// homogeneity is consider within read or write domains in three different
// categories: buffered, non-buffered, and vectored.  Thus, it is advised that,
// for optimal performance, only one category within domain is used.  If timed
// operations are not required, &#39;btlsos_tcpcbchannel&#39; is preferred from
// performance perspective.
//
///Usage
///-----
//..
// See the {&#39;btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor&#39;} component.
