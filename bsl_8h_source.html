@PURPOSE: Provide a comprehensive foundation for component-based development.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library (bsl)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bsl&#39; (&quot;Basic Standard Library&quot;) package group contains
 various packages that provide platform-specific classes, meta-functions,
 defensive programming mechanisms, a framework for component testing, memory
 allocation protocols and algorithms, and a C++ standard library
 implementation.

 Note that the C++ standard library is implemented in the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace
 instead of the standard &#39;std&#39; namespace.  This allow clients to use both the
 native compiler provided C++ standard library together with the Bloomberg
 provided C++ standard library in the same translation unit.

 If clients wish to use the Bloomberg provided standard library as the default
 standard library (as in the case with Bloomberg managed code), specifying
 &#39;-DBSL_OVERRIDES_STD&#39; on the compile line will render &#39;std&#39; as merely an alias
 to &#39;bsl&#39; (i.e., &#39;std::vector&#39; will be the same as &#39;bsl::vector&#39;).  This is
 also known as the &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.  For more information, please see the
 package level documentation in &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;bsl&#39; package group is the foundation of the firm-wide BDE library and has
 no dependencies beyond the allowed OS and runtime environment dependencies.

 The &#39;bsl&#39; package group currently has 11 packages forming 10 levels of
 physical dependency.  The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the
 packages.  The order of components within each level is not architecturally
 significant, just alphabetical.
..
  10. bslim

   9. bsl+stdhdrs(*)

   8. bsl+bslhdrs

   7. bslstl

   6. bsltf

   5. bslalg

   4. bslma

   3. bsldoc
      bslmf

   2. bslscm

   1. bsls
..
 (*) - Note that the &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; package is only a compatibility layer for
 Bloomberg managed code.  It is not an essential package for the rest of the
 BDE libraries (i.e., all other package groups above &#39;bsl&#39; will compile and
 function without &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;).  This package implements the logic required
 for &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 The following provides a brief overview of the packages within the &#39;bsl&#39;
 package group, arranged in alphabetical order.  Note that several packages,
 especially at lower levels in the physical hierarchy, are primarily intended
 for use by other packages within &#39;bsl&#39;.  The descriptions here are still very
 brief; see the respective Package Level documents for more details and usage
 examples.

/&#39;bsl+bslhdrs&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 {&#39;bsl+bslhdrs&#39;} provides the &#39;bsl&#39; version of the standard C++ library (e.g.,
 &#39;bsl_vector.h&#39; instead of &#39;vector&#39;, &#39;bsl_algorithm.h&#39; instead of &#39;algorithm&#39;).
 Users of &#39;bsl&#39; can include these headers to obtain the corresponding C++ STL
 functionalities.

/&#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 {&#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;} provides a compatibility layer to for the &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.
 When users include standard C++ headers from this directory (e.g., &#39;vector&#39;,
 &#39;algorithm&#39;), and use standard STL types such as &#39;std::vector&#39;, &#39;std::cout&#39;,
 users will be using the corresponding &#39;bsl&#39; version instead (i.e.,
 &#39;std::vector&#39; is the same as &#39;bsl::vector&#39;).

/&#39;bslalg&#39;
/ - - - -
 {&#39;bslalg&#39;} provides a variety of lower-level algorithms, comparisons, and
 traits.

/&#39;bsldoc&#39;
/ - - - -
 {&#39;bsldoc&#39;} documents key terminology and concepts used throughout BDE
 documentation.  Note that the components in this package consist entirely of
 comments, no code.

/&#39;bslim&#39;
/- - - -
 {&#39;bslim&#39;} provides implementation mechanisms for features that must have
 identical syntax and semantics in many disparate classes.

/&#39;bslma&#39;
/- - - -
 {&#39;bslma&#39;} provides memory allocation and related proctor and handle objects.

/&#39;bslmf&#39;
/- - - -
 {&#39;bslmf&#39;} provides low-level &quot;meta-functions&quot; implementing &quot;traits&quot; and other
 useful properties of types, determined at compile-time.

/&#39;bsls&#39;
/ - - -
 {&#39;bsls&#39;} provides the needed platform-independent definitions and utilities
 (with platform-specific implementations) so that the rest of the bsl library,
 and all conforming applications within the Development Framework, can be
 written in a truly portable, platform-neutral dialect of C++ -- one having
 dependency on &#39;bsls&#39;, but on no other system-specific services.  Among the
 issues dealt with in &#39;bsls&#39; are hardware, operating system, and compiler
 definitions, &quot;endian-ness&quot; and alignment of type representation in physical
 memory, bit-manipulation utilities, and a uniform interface to system services
 (e.g., timers).

/&#39;bslscm&#39;
/ - - - -
 {&#39;bslscm&#39;} is a special source control management package containing only two
 components, &#39;bslscm_version&#39; and &#39;bslscm_versiontag&#39;.  The first of these
 components is included by every other component in &#39;bsl&#39;, and provides
 versioning information for the package group.  Users may use the
 &#39;bslscm_version&#39; facilities to query a particular &#39;bsl&#39; library for its
 version information.  The second component defines macros that can be used for
 conditional-compilation based on &#39;bsl&#39; version information.

/&#39;bslstl&#39;
/ - - - -
 {&#39;bslstl&#39;} provides an implementation of certain containers of the C++
 standard library using the &#39;bslma&#39; memory allocation model, algorithms and
 traits in &#39;bslalg&#39; and meta-functions in &#39;bslmf&#39;.

/&#39;bsltf&#39;
/- - - -
 {&#39;bsltf&#39;} provides a set test types and utilities that operates on those
 types, which can help simplify, particularly for template, the implementation
 of test drivers.
