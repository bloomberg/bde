@PURPOSE: Provide a comprehensive foundation for component-based development.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library (bsl)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bsl&#39; (&quot;Basic Standard Library&quot;) package group contains
 various packages that provide platform-specific classes, meta-functions,
 defensive programming mechanisms, a framework for component testing, memory
 allocation protocols and algorithms, and a C++ standard library
 implementation.

 Note that the C++ standard library is implemented in the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace
 instead of the standard &#39;std&#39; namespace.  This allow clients to use both the
 native compiler provided C++ standard library together with the Bloomberg
 provided C++ standard library in the same translation unit.

 If clients wish to use the Bloomberg provided standard library as the default
 standard library (as in the case with Bloomberg managed code), specifying
 &#39;-DBSL_OVERRIDES_STD&#39; on the compile line will render &#39;std&#39; as merely an alias
 to &#39;bsl&#39; (i.e., &#39;std::vector&#39; will be the same as &#39;bsl::vector&#39;).  This is
 also known as the &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.  For more information, please see the
 package level documentation in &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;.

 The &#39;bsl&#39; package group is the foundation of the firm-wide BDE library and has
 no dependencies beyond the allowed OS and runtime environment dependencies.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;bsl&#39; package group currently has 14 packages having 11 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the packages.
 The order of packages within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
..
  11. bslmt
      bslx

  10. bslim

   9. bsl+stdhdrs

   8. bsl+bslhdrs

   7. bslstl

   6. bsltf

   5. bslalg

   4. bslh
      bslma

   3. bsldoc
      bslmf

   2. bslscm

   1. bsls
..
 Note that the &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; package is only a compatibility layer for
 Bloomberg managed code.  It is not an essential package for the rest of the
 BDE libraries (i.e., all other package groups above &#39;bsl&#39; will compile and
 function without &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;).  This package implements the logic required
 for &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.

 Note that required source control package &#39;bslscm&#39; depends on &#39;bsls&#39;; this
 behavior is unique to &#39;bsl&#39;, although it is temporarily also in &#39;bde&#39; for
 historic reasons, since logically *every* other package should depend on
 &#39;bslscm&#39;.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to the packages of the &#39;bsl&#39;
 package group.  Note that several packages, especially at lower levels in the
 physical hierarchy, are primarily intended for use by other packages within
 &#39;bsl&#39;.  See the respective Package Level documents for more details.

/&#39;bsl+bslhdrs&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bsl+bslhdrs&#39;} package provides the &#39;bsl&#39; version of the standard C++
 library (e.g., &#39;bsl_vector.h&#39; instead of &#39;vector&#39;, &#39;bsl_algorithm.h&#39; instead
 of &#39;algorithm&#39;).  Users of &#39;bsl&#39; can include these headers to obtain the
 corresponding C++ STL functionalities.

/&#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;} package provides a compatibility layer to for the
 &#39;BDE-STL&#39; mode.  When users include standard C++ headers from this directory
 (e.g., &#39;vector&#39;, &#39;algorithm&#39;), and use standard STL types such as
 &#39;std::vector&#39;, &#39;std::cout&#39;, users will be using the corresponding &#39;bsl&#39;
 version instead (i.e., &#39;std::vector&#39; is the same as &#39;bsl::vector&#39;).

/&#39;bslalg&#39;
/ - - - -
 The {&#39;bslalg&#39;} package provides a variety of lower-level algorithms,
 comparisons, and traits.

/&#39;bsldoc&#39;
/ - - - -
 The {&#39;bsldoc&#39;} package documents key terminology and concepts used throughout
 BDE documentation.  Note that the components in this package consist entirely
 of comments, no code.

/&#39;bslh&#39;
/ - - -
 The {&#39;bslh&#39;} package provides standard hashing algorithms and components
 allowing the application of those hashing algorithms to types in a modular
 way.

/&#39;bslim&#39;
/- - - -
 The {&#39;bslim&#39;} package provides implementation mechanisms for features that
 must have identical syntax and semantics in many disparate classes.

/&#39;bslma&#39;
/- - - -
 {&#39;bslma&#39;} provides memory allocation and related proctor and handle objects.

/&#39;bslmf&#39;
/- - - -
 The {&#39;bslmf&#39;} package provides low-level &quot;meta-functions&quot; implementing
 &quot;traits&quot; and other useful properties of types, determined at compile-time.

/&#39;bsls&#39;
/ - - -
 The {&#39;bsls&#39;} package provides the needed platform-independent definitions and
 utilities (with platform-specific implementations) so that the rest of the bsl
 library, and all conforming applications within the Development Framework, can
 be written in a truly portable, platform-neutral dialect of C++ -- one having
 dependency on &#39;bsls&#39;, but on no other system-specific services.  Among the
 issues dealt with in &#39;bsls&#39; are hardware, operating system, and compiler
 definitions, &quot;endian-ness&quot; and alignment of type representation in physical
 memory, bit-manipulation utilities, and a uniform interface to system services
 (e.g., timers).

/&#39;bslscm&#39;
/ - - - -
 The {&#39;bslscm&#39;} package contains only two components, &#39;bslscm_version&#39; and
 &#39;bslscm_versiontag&#39;.  The first of these components is included by every other
 component in &#39;bsl&#39;, and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the &#39;bslscm_version&#39; facilities to query a particular &#39;bsl&#39;
 library for its version information.  The second component defines macros that
 can be used for conditional-compilation based on &#39;bsl&#39; version information.

/&#39;bslstl&#39;
/ - - - -
 The {&#39;bslstl&#39;} package provides implementations of certain containers of the
 C++ standard library using the &#39;bslma&#39; memory allocation model, algorithms and
 traits in &#39;bslalg&#39; and meta-functions in &#39;bslmf&#39;.

/&#39;bsltf&#39;
/- - - -
 The {&#39;bsltf&#39;} package provides a set test types and utilities that operates on
 those types, which can help simplify, particularly for template, the
 implementation of test drivers.

/&#39;bslx&#39;
/ - - -
 The {&#39;bslx&#39;} package defines (via documentation) the BDEX protocol for
 externalization (i.e., for an &quot;out stream&quot;) and &quot;unexternalization&quot; (i.e., for
 an &quot;in stream&quot;), and provides concrete byte-array-based stream implementations
 of each kind of stream, including streams for testing.
