Build Instructions
==================
BDE uses a build system based on [cmake](https://cmake.org).  The build system is located in the
BDE tools repository (see [Documentation Links](#documentation-links)).

Prerequisites
-------------
The BDE CMake build system requires the following software to be preinstalled and configured on the system:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.12 or later
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (recommended) or GNU Make
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Note that `python` is used by the build helpers `bde_build_env.py` and `cmake_build.py`, but is not strictly needed
to build BDE.  See the more complete build instructions linked below for more detail.

Build Instructions (Open Source)
--------------------------------
Please see the more complete [build instructions for open source users](https://bloomberg.github.io/bde/library_information/build.html).

The following commands can be used to configure and build the BDE repository:
1. Clone the `bde-tools` and `bde` repositories and add `bde-tools` to your `PATH`:
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools.git
   $ export PATH=$PWD/bde-tools/bin:$PATH      # add bde-tools to the 'PATH'
   $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde.git
   $ cd bde
   ```

2. From the root of this source repository, run:

   ```shell
   $ export BDE_CMAKE_BUILD_DIR=$PWD/_build   # configure the build directory
   $ cmake_build.py configure -u dbg_exc_mt_64_cpp14
   ```

3. To build the libraries, but not the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build
   ```

   To also build the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test build
   ```

   To build and run the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test run
   ```

Build Instructions (Bloomberg LP)
---------------------------------
Please see the more complete [build instructions for Bloomberg LP users](https://bde.bloomberg.com/bde/library_information/build.html).

The following commands can be used to configure and build the BDE repository:
1. Clone the `bde-tools` and `bde` repositories and add `bde-tools` to your `PATH`:
   ```shell
   $ git clone bbgithub:bde/bde-tools
   $ export PATH=$PWD/bde-tools/bin:$PATH      # add bde-tools to the 'PATH'
   $ git clone bbgithub:bde/bde
   $ cd bde
   ```

2. From the root of this source repository, run:

   ```shell
   $ export BDE_CMAKE_BUILD_DIR=$PWD/_build   # configure the build directory
   $ cmake_build.py configure -u dbg_exc_mt_64_cpp14
   ```

3. To build the libraries, but not the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build
   ```

   To also build the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test build
   ```

   To build and run the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   $ cmake_build.py build --test run
   ```

Build Instructions (Vcpkg)
---------------------------------
You can build and install bde using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

```sh or powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install bde
```

The bde port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
