@PURPOSE: Provide concrete TCP/IPv4 channels derived from &#39;btlsc&#39; protocols.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment SOcket-based Streams (btlsos)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;btlsos&#39; package provides concrete imlpementations of &#39;btlsc&#39;
 channels using TCP/IPv4 sockets.  Timed and untimed, and blocking and
 non-blocking versions of generic channels, acceptors, and connectors are
 provided.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;btlsos&#39; package currently has 12 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
