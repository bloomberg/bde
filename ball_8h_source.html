@PURPOSE: Provide thread-safe logging toolkit suitable for all platforms.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Application Environment Logging (ball)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;ball&#39; package provides a toolkit for logging messages in
 applications and library code.  The logger toolkit has an administration layer
 that allows configuration both at start-up and during program execution, a
 basic logger API for the most general possible use, and two sets of macros for
 somewhat less flexible but simpler, more convenient use.  In particular,
 messages may be logged via these macros in either a C++ stream-style syntax
 (i.e., with the &#39;&lt;&lt;&#39; operator) or a &#39;printf&#39;-style syntax.  Users are
 encouraged to use the macros exclusively, because they provide uniformity, and
 because they are less error-prone.  See the {Appendix: Macro Reference}
 section below.

/Multi-Threaded Logging
/----------------------
 The &#39;ball&#39; logging toolkit is thread-enabled and suitable for multi-threaded
 applications.  At the user&#39;s option, the multi-threaded toolkit permits each
 thread to install a distinct instance of &#39;ball_Logger&#39;; the process-wide
 &quot;default&quot; logger is available to any thread that does not install its own
 logger.

/Logging Features Overview
/-------------------------
 This section provides a brief overview of the features of the &#39;ball&#39; logging
 toolkit, and introduces (without formal definition) some of the terminology
 used in &#39;ball&#39;.  Refer to the hierarchical and alphabetical Synopsis sections
 above to associate these features with the overall &#39;ball&#39; design, and see the
 various sections below for more detailed descriptions.

: o User-assigned Severity Level associated with each log message
:
: o User-defined Category associated with each log message
:
: o Four Severity Threshold Levels associated with each Category
:
: o Category threshold levels are administrable both at start-up and during
:   program execution
:
: o Severity Level plus (administrable) per-category Threshold Levels allow:
:   o efficient suppression of message-logging operation (one &#39;if&#39; statement)
:   o efficient logging-to-memory (subsequent publication is user-controlled)
:   o immediate publication of log message (to user-defined &quot;observer&quot;)
:   o immediate publication of all messages currently held in (finite) buffer
:
: o Logging to memory permits efficient logging of large quantities of &quot;trace&quot;
:   information that will not be published *unless* a specific user-defined
:   logging event occurs (&quot;trace-back&quot; feature)
:
: o User can always configure logger to publish every message, if desired
:
: o User defines and registers an &quot;observer&quot;, which in turn defines the
:   behavior of the &quot;publish&quot; operation (e.g., write to file, write to console,
:   process message and take specific action, etc.)
:
: o Convenient logging macros simplify usage for the most common operations
:
: o Optional functors and other parameters allow customized logging behavior
:   (e.g., default threshold levels, category name filtering)

 The &#39;ball&#39; package provides a flexible logging toolkit that supports several
 standard and non-standard features.  Perhaps most notable among the
 non-standard features is the ability to write messages to an in-memory
 &quot;circular&quot; (finite) buffer with the expectation that those messages will be
 overwritten and never actually &quot;logged&quot; to any permanent medium.  With this
 feature, during normal production operation a large quantity of &quot;trace-back&quot;
 information can be &quot;logged&quot; to memory, and typically be discarded, without
 having clogged production resources.  If, however, some &quot;error&quot; occurs, the
 information just prior to that error will be available for fast diagnosis and
 debugging.  It is easy to re-configure logger operation so that every message
 is archived, if that is the preferred behavior, but the efficient trace-back
 feature is an explicit design goal.  See the &quot;Hello world!&quot; examples under
 {Usage} below for illustrations of how to configure the logger behavior.

 Another key design feature is the &quot;observer&quot; object.  &#39;ball&#39; defines the
 &#39;ball_Observer&#39; protocol (abstract interface), and provides a few concrete
 observers.  It is expected that most users will find the concrete observers
 that are provided in &#39;ball&#39; to be sufficient for their needs.  However, users
 are free to define their own observers tailored to meet their specific
 requirements.  In the current release, exactly one observer is registered with
 the &#39;ball&#39; logger on initialization; we anticipate that multiple observers,
 e.g., one per thread or perhaps one per logger, may be available in future
 releases.  An observer makes its &#39;publish&#39; method available to the logger;
 since the &#39;publish&#39; method is free to do almost anything that the user wants,
 the limitation of one observer per process is not very restrictive.  The
 observer may: write the message to a simple file, write the message to a set
 of managed files, write the message to the console (perhaps with some
 information removed and/or added), process the message (complete with Category
 and Severity information) and take specific responsive actions, or any
 combination of these or other behaviors.  In particular, &#39;ball&#39; provides a
 &quot;multiplexing observer&quot;, so that the one observer registered with the logger
 can forward messages to any number of observers that are separately registered
 with the multiplexing observer (and are therefore unknown to the logger
 proper).

/Severity Levels and Categories: a Brief Overview
/------------------------------------------------
 The logger supports the notions of severity levels and categories.  Every
 message is logged at some severity level and to some category.  Categories are
 user-defined (except for the &quot;default category&quot;), and can be separately
 managed; in particular, the behavior of any given message-logging operation
 depends upon specific severity level threshold settings for the category to
 which the message is being logged.  See the &#39;ball_loggermanager&#39; component for
 more details about categories and category administration.

 Severity levels are, from the perspective of the basic logger API,
 user-settable in the range &#39;[0 .. 255]&#39;.  Much more commonly, however, (and
 necessarily when using the &#39;ball&#39; convenience macros defined in the &#39;ball_log&#39;
 component), the user will choose to use the fixed set of enumerated severity
 levels as defined in the &#39;ball_severity&#39; component.  The enumerator names
 suggest a meaning that is consistent with common practice, but no policy is
 enforced by the basic logger API or the macros.

 For convenient reference only, the &#39;ball_Severity::Level&#39; &#39;enum&#39;
 implementation is presented below.  Note that this implementation and the
 specific numerical values may not be relied upon.  Note also that the
 enumerator &#39;NONE&#39; is deprecated, since its name has proven to be confusing.
 As an argument to &#39;logMessage&#39;, it would satisfy &quot;none&quot; of the thresholds, but
 when provided as a threshold value itself, it would enable &quot;all&quot; of the
 enumerated &#39;logMessage&#39; requests (and all of the macros).  Use &#39;e_OFF&#39; as a
 threshold level to disable all logging events for a particular logging
 behavior (see the &quot;Log Record Storage and Publication&quot; section below).
..
  enum Level {
      e_OFF   =   0,  // disable generation of corresponding message
      e_FATAL =  32,  // a condition that will (likely) cause a *crash*
      e_ERROR =  64,  // a condition that *will* cause incorrect behavior
      e_WARN  =  96,  // a *potentially* problematic condition
      e_INFO  = 128,  // data about the running process
      e_DEBUG = 160,  // information useful while debugging
      e_TRACE = 192,  // execution trace data
  };
..
 Note that numerically lower &#39;Level&#39; values correspond to conditions having
 greater severity.

/Messages, Records, and other &#39;ball&#39; Terminology
/-----------------------------------------------
 The entity that the logger logs is called in &#39;ball&#39; a &quot;log record&quot;, which
 consists of a number of fixed and user-defined fields; one of the fixed fields
 is called a &quot;log message&quot; (or &quot;message&quot; for short).  In casual usage, we use
 &quot;record&quot; and &quot;message&quot; interchangeably, but note that they are distinct
 concepts.  The set of fixed fields that constitute a log record are defined in
 the &#39;ball_recordattributes&#39; component.  A brief description of the fixed
 fields (or &quot;record attributes&quot;) is given in the following table.
..
   Attribute        Type               Description               Default
   ----------   -------------   ------------------------------   -------
   timestamp    bdet_Datetime   creation date and time           (*Note*)
   processID    int             process id of creator              0
   threadID     int             thread id of creator               0
   fileName     bdl::string     file where created  (__FILE__)     &quot;&quot;
   lineNumber   int             line number in file (__LINE__)     0
   category     bdl::string     category of logged record          &quot;&quot;
   severity     int             severity of logged record          0
   message      bdl::string     log message text                   &quot;&quot;

   Note: The default value given to the timestamp attribute is implementation
         defined.  (See the &#39;bdet_datetime&#39; component-level documentation for
         more information.)
..
 The user may wish to specify a set of user-defined fields to be included
 within every log record for a given program.  Such user-defined fields are
 represented in each log record as the elements of a &#39;bdem_List&#39;, which is in
 turn described by a &#39;bdem_Schema&#39; object.  The schema is provided to the
 logger manager on construction (via the &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39;
 object).  Whenever a schema is specified to the configuration object, a
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration::UserPopulatorCallback&#39; functor must also be
 supplied; the &#39;UserPopulatorCallback&#39;, when invoked, &quot;populates&quot; (i.e.,
 provides the values for) all elements of the &#39;bdem_List&#39; containing the
 user-defined fields.  See the &#39;ball_record&#39; component for more information
 about the use of &#39;bdem_List&#39; in logging, and see the &#39;ball_loggermanager&#39;
 component for more information about installing a &#39;bdem_Schema&#39; and a user
 populator callback that will describe the &#39;bdem_List&#39; used in each log record.

/Constraints on Message Encodings
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The &#39;ball&#39; infrastructure has no provisions for specifying or enforcing
 constraints on the encoding used for logged messages (in general, logged
 messages are published to registered observers in the encoding in which they
 were originally supplied).  However, particular applications, frameworks, and
 consumers of log records (e.g., readers of log files) may place their own
 constraints on log records with respect to encoding.  Clients generating log
 records should be aware of the encoding requirements for logged messages
 generated by their application (e.g., many applications at Bloomberg require
 UTF-8 encoded messages).

/Log Record Storage and Publication
/----------------------------------
 The logger achieves good run-time performance while capturing critical log
 messages by *selectively* storing log records and *selectively* publishing a
 subset of those stored records.  The determination of whether a log record
 should be stored or published is based on the &quot;category&quot; and &quot;severity&quot; level
 that are associated with each record.  The severity of a record is intended to
 indicate that record&#39;s relative urgency.  A category is comprised of a name
 (an arbitrary string) and four severity threshold levels (see the
 component-level documentation of &#39;ball_severity&#39; for more information on
 typical severity levels).  A message&#39;s text, its associated severity, and the
 name of its associated category are each among the fixed fields in the logged
 record (see the &quot;Messages, Records, and other &#39;ball&#39; Terminology&quot; section
 above).

 The following four settings define the log record severity levels at which the
 logger takes certain actions.  The logger determines the disposition of a
 record based on its severity level in relation to the four *severity*
 *threshold* *levels* of the category associated with the message:

: Record:
:   If the severity level of the record is at least as severe as the Record
:   threshold level of the associated category, then the record will be stored
:   by the logger in its log record buffer (i.e., it will be recorded).
:
: Pass:
:   If the severity level of the record is at least as severe as the Pass
:   threshold level of the associated category, then the record will be
:   immediately published by the logger (i.e., it will be transmitted to the
:   logger&#39;s downstream recipient -- the observer).
:
: Trigger:
:   If the severity level of the record is at least as severe as the Trigger
:   threshold level of the associated category, then the record will cause
:   immediate publication of that record and any records in the logger&#39;s log
:   record buffer (i.e., this record will trigger a general log record dump).
:
: Trigger-All:
:   If the severity level of the record is at least as severe as the
:   Trigger-All threshold level of the associated category, then the record
:   will cause immediate publication of that record and all other log records
:   stored by *all* active loggers.

 Note that more than one of the above actions can apply to a given log record
 since the four threshold levels are independent of one another.  Also note
 that the determination of whether a log record should cause a Trigger or
 Trigger-All event is based on the trigger and trigger-all threshold levels,
 respectively, of the category associated with the record being logged.  The
 categories and severities associated with log records stored earlier are not
 taken into account.

/The Basic Tools in the &#39;ball&#39; Logging Toolkit
/---------------------------------------------
 This section will be expanded upon in the future.  For now, we provide a brief
 introduction to the objects that are most central to understanding basic
 logger operation, so that we may use their names elsewhere in this
 documentation.

/&#39;ball_LoggerManager&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - -
 &#39;ball_LoggerManager&#39; is a singleton that must be constructed with an observer
 (see below), a configuration object (see below), and an optional &#39;bdema&#39;
 allocator before any true logging operations can be performed.  The logger
 manager&#39;s main tasks are to administer categories and to &quot;allocate&quot; loggers.
 If the user has *not* allocated and installed any logger instances, then the
 &#39;getLogger&#39; method will return the &quot;default logger&quot;, which is a specific
 instance of &#39;ball_Logger&#39; that is owned and managed by the logger manager.
 This default logger is suitable for single-threaded and multi-threaded use,
 and is used &quot;transparently&quot; by users willing to accept default-logger
 behavior.  See {Usage} below.

 The logger manager provides the &#39;allocateLogger&#39; and &#39;setLogger&#39; methods,
 which allocate arbitrarily many loggers and install (at most) one logger per
 thread, respectively.  Any thread in which the &#39;setLogger&#39; method was not
 called will use the default logger.  See {Example 6} and {Example 7} below for
 a discussion of how and why to allocate multiple loggers.

/&#39;ball_Logger&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 &#39;ball_Logger&#39; provides the most central logging functionality, namely the
 &#39;logMessage&#39; method.  However, most users will never call &#39;logMessage&#39;
 directly, but rather will use the sets of macros defined in the &#39;ball_log&#39;
 component.  See the {Appendix: Macro Reference} section below.

 The &quot;default&quot; &#39;ball_Logger&#39; instance managed by the logger manager is suitable
 for many purposes, so typical users need never interact with logger instances
 explicitly at all.  However, in multi-threaded applications (and perhaps also
 in certain special-purpose single-threaded programs), the user may want to
 instantiate one or more logger instances and install at most one logger
 instance per thread.  See {Example 6} and {Example 7} below.

/&#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; is a &quot;configuration&quot; object that must be
 supplied to the logger manager at construction.  The default object configures
 the &quot;default&quot; logging behavior; the user can change the logger behavior by
 changing attributes in the configuration object.  The name, type, and
 description of the configuration attributes are presented in the two tables
 below; the awkward repetition of &#39;NAME&#39; is due to the long type names of the
 functor types.
..

  -------------------   -----------------------------------------------------
  defaults              constrained defaults for buffer size and thresholds

  userSchema            defines optional user fields in a log record

  userPopulatorCallback populates optional user fields in a log record

  categoryNameFilterCallback
                        invoked on category names, e.g., to re-map characters

  logOrder              log message publication order on &quot;trigger&quot; events
..
 Note that the configuration object is not value-semantic, because its three
 functor attributes are not value-semantic.  For this reason, the single
 &quot;defaults&quot; attribute, which is a value-semantic constrained-attributes type,
 was factored out from the configuration type.  The defaults object, which
 holds six numerical attributes, is described in the next sub-section below.

/&#39;ball_LoggerManagerDefaults&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerDefaults&#39; is a value-semantic constrained-attributes type
 that is itself an attribute of the above &quot;configuration&quot; object.  The
 &quot;defaults&quot; object contains the following six constrained attributes.
..
  TYPE          NAME                DESCRIPTION
  -----------   ----------------    -------------------------------------
  int           recordBufferSize    size in bytes of *default* logger&#39;s

  int           loggerBufferSize    default size in bytes of *each*

  char          passLevel           default pass-through severity level

  char          triggerLevel        default trigger severity level

  char          triggerAllLevel     default trigger-all severity level
..
 The constraints are as follows:

 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerDefaults&#39; was factored out of the configuration object
 because the former is purely value-semantic, and can be generated from, e.g.,
 a configuration file.  From this perspective, it is very convenient to set
 this one attribute in the configuration object.  It is quite possible to
 ignore the independent existence of &#39;ball_LoggerManagerDefaults&#39; and set the
 above constrained attributes directly in the &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39;
 object.  The latter is more convenient in &quot;simple&quot; usage, and is illustrated
 in {Usage} below.

/&#39;ball_Observer&#39;
/- - - - - - - -
 &#39;ball_Observer&#39; is the object that receives &quot;published&quot; log messages.
 Specifically, &#39;ball_Observer&#39; is a protocol (abstract interface), and the user
 must supply a concrete implementation (separately written or chosen from
 existing &#39;ball&#39; observers).  The observer provides a &#39;publish&#39; method that
 defines the behavior of the logical concept of &quot;publication&quot; of a message used
 throughout this document.  Note that, although only one observer may be
 registered with the logger manager, &#39;ball&#39; provides a multiplexing observer
 (&#39;ball_MultiplexObserver&#39;), which in turn accepts registry of multiple
 observers.

/Logging Macros
/- - - - - - -
 For both convenience and uniformity of programming, &#39;ball&#39; provides a suite of
 logging macros (defined in the &#39;ball_log&#39; component).  All but the most
 demanding and customized applications will use the logging macros for basic
 logging operations (e.g., setting categories and logging messages).  The
 logger manager interface is used primarily to administer global and
 category-specific severity threshold levels, and to allocate loggers.  See the
 {Usage} and {Appendix: Macro Reference} sections below for examples and
 reference documentation, respectively.

 The user should note the following two facts about macro usage:

: 1 The &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; macro is not only convenient, it is *required*
:   for macro use, since it defines symbols that the other macros expect to
:   see.
:
: 2 There are two styles of logging macros, C++ stream style and &#39;printf&#39;
:   style.  The &#39;printf&#39;-style logging macros write to an intermediate
:   fixed-size buffer managed by the active logger instance.  For any one macro
:   invocation, data larger than the buffer size is (silently) truncated.  The
:   buffer size is 8k bytes by default; the buffer size can be queried by the
:   logger &#39;messageBufferSize&#39; instance method, and can be set at logger
:   manager construction via the &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; object.
:   (This is not the case with the C++ stream-style macros, which are more
:   efficient.)

/More About Categories
/---------------------
 When the logger manager singleton is created, a distinguished category known
 as the *Default* *Category* is created.  At initialization, the *Default*
 *Category* is given &quot;factory-supplied&quot; default threshold levels.  These
 threshold levels, values distributed in the range &#39;[0 .. 255]&#39;, are not
 published and are subject to change over time.  Explicit settings for these
 factory values may be specified when the singleton is constructed.  This is
 done by constructing a &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; object (needed for
 logger manager construction in any event) and then calling the
 &#39;setDefaultThresholdLevelsIfValid&#39; method with the desired values for its four
 arguments before supplying the configuration object to the logger manager
 configuration.

 The *Default* *Category* may arise during logging whenever the
 &#39;setCategory(const char *categoryName)&#39; method is called.  That method returns
 the address of the category having &#39;categoryName&#39;, if it exists; if no such
 category exists, and a category having &#39;categoryName&#39; cannot be created due to
 a capacity limitation on the category registry maintained by the logger
 manager singleton, then the *Default* *Category* is returned.

 Categories that are added to the registry during logging through calls to the
 &#39;setCategory(const char *)&#39; method are given threshold levels by one of two
 means.  One alternative is to use the
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration::DefaultThresholdLevelsCallback&#39; functor that
 is optionally supplied by the client when the logger manager singleton is
 initialized.  If such a functor *is* provided by the client, then it is used
 to supply threshold levels to categories added by &#39;setCategory(const char *)&#39;.
 Otherwise, default threshold levels maintained by the logger manager for that
 purpose are used.  At initialization, these default threshold levels are given
 the same &quot;factory-supplied&quot; settings as those for the *Default* *Category*,
 which again may be explicitly overridden at construction.

 The default threshold levels can be adjusted (&#39;setDefaultThresholdLevels&#39;) and
 reset to their original values (&#39;resetDefaultThresholdLevels&#39;).  Note that if
 factory values are overridden at initialization, a reset will restore
 thresholds to the user-specified default values.  In addition, there is a
 method to set the threshold levels of a given category to the current default
 threshold levels (&#39;setCategoryThresholdsToCurrentDefaults&#39;) or to the
 factory-supplied (or client-overridden) default values
 (&#39;setCategoryThresholdsToFactoryDefaults&#39;).

 One final note regarding categories is that the client can optionally supply a
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration::CategoryNameFilterCallback&#39; functor to
 translate category names from an external to an internal representation.  For
 example, a project may allow programmers to refer to categories using
 mixed-case within an application, but provide a &#39;toLower&#39;
 &#39;CategoryNameFilterCallback&#39; to map all external upper-case letters to
 lower-case internally.  Such a name-filtering functor is set in the
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; object before that configuration object is
 passed to the logger manager scoped guard constructor.  In this scenario, the
 (hypothetical) external category names &quot;EQUITY.MARKET.NYSE&quot; and
 &quot;equity.market.nyse&quot; would be mapped to the same category internally by the
 presumed &#39;toLower&#39; functor.

/A Note on Multi-Threaded Logging Usage
/--------------------------------------
 The &#39;ball&#39; logging toolkit may be used in single-threaded and multi-threaded
 library code and applications with equal ease, and with virtually no
 difference in coding.  In particular, the same call to the logger manager
 scoped guard constructor is required in &#39;main&#39; in both cases, and individual
 calls to the &#39;ball_Logger&#39; instance method &#39;logMessage&#39; (and logging calls via
 the logging macros -- see &#39;ball_log&#39; and the {Appendix: Macro Reference}
 below) are identical from the user&#39;s perspective.  Category threshold
 administration is also identical in both cases, since that is done by the
 singleton logger manager.

 Differences in logger usage, or, more precisely, additional options for the
 multi-threaded user, arise when the user wishes to allocate one or more
 loggers beyond the default logger, which is owned by the singleton logger
 manager.  If a user does *not* explicitly allocate a logger (via the logger
 manager instance method &#39;allocateLogger&#39;) and install that logger for a given
 thread (via the manager instance method &#39;setLogger&#39;), then all records from
 all threads in a program will be logged to the one default logger.  However,
 since each thread of execution may have its own logger instance,
 multi-threaded users may choose to allocate and install multiple loggers.
 Note that each thread may have at most one logger, but a single logger may be
 used by any number of threads.

 Multi-threaded users of logging may prefer to allocate and install one logger
 per thread in order to take advantage of the &quot;trace-back&quot; feature described
 above on a per-thread basis.  In the event of an &quot;error condition&quot; (as defined
 by the *user*), such a logging configuration can provide a trace-back through
 the record buffer of the thread that caused the error, without any dilution
 from records logged from other threads.  Conversely, if several threads are
 known to interact closely, it may be advantageous to have them share a common
 logger so that the trace-back log *does* include relevant records from all
 designated threads, in reverse chronological order.

/Managing the &#39;ball_LoggerManager&#39; Singleton
/-------------------------------------------
 The recommended way to initialize the logger manager singleton is to create a
 &#39;ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard&#39; object in &#39;main&#39; (*before* creating any
 threads).  The logger manager scoped guard constructor takes an observer, a
 configuration object (an instance of &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39;), and
 an optional allocator.  The logger manager singleton is created as a
 side-effect of creating the scoped guard object.  When the guard object goes
 out of scope (i.e., on program exit), the logger manager singleton is
 automatically destroyed.

 As an alternative to using the logger manager scoped guard, the &#39;static&#39;
 &#39;ball_LoggerManager::initSingleton&#39; method that takes the same arguments as
 the scoped guard constructor may be used to initialize the singleton.
 However, in this case the &#39;ball_LoggerManager::shutDownSingleton&#39; method must
 be explicitly called to destroy the logger manager singleton on program exit.
 Unless &#39;shutDownSingleton&#39; is called, the singleton will not be destroyed and
 resources used by the singleton will leak.

 Direct use of the &#39;public&#39; logger manager constructor to initialize the logger
 manager singleton is *deprecated*.  The constructor will be declared &#39;private&#39;
 in a future release.

 Direct use of any of the 16 &#39;ball_LoggerManager::initSingleton&#39; methods that
 do *not* take an instance of &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; to initialize
 the logger manager singleton is *deprecated*.  These methods will be
 eliminated in a future release.

/Usage
/-----
 This section provides a set of logging examples designed to introduce and
 illustrate basic concepts, features, and resulting operation.  The first four
 examples are very simple &quot;Hello world!&quot; programs that show single-threaded
 usage.  The next three examples illustrate multi-threaded usage.  As simple as
 these examples are, they show sufficient functionality to use the &#39;ball&#39;
 logger in a fair number of production applications.  In particular, all of
 these examples use the macros from the &#39;ball_log&#39; component to perform the
 actual logging.  Methods from &#39;ball_loggermanager&#39; are used for initialization
 and administration, but for most applications, anything that *can* be done
 using the logging macros *should* be done with the macros.

/Example 1: Hello World!
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 This &quot;Hello world!&quot; example illustrates the most basic use of logging within a
 single translation unit containing a &#39;main&#39; function and essentially nothing
 else.  Among the points of usage that we illustrate are:

: o Instantiating a &#39;ball_DefaultObserver&#39; and passing it to the logger manager
:   scoped guard constructor.
:
: o Instantiating a &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; and passing it to the
:   logger manager scoped guard constructor.
:
: o Invoking the &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; macro to set a category (named &quot;main
:   category&quot; in this example); records logged from a scope where the effects
:   of the macro are visible (and not superseded by a macro invocation in a
:   nested scope) will be logged to this category.
:
: o Using the &#39;BAEL_LOG_INFO&#39; macro to log a &quot;Hello world!&quot; message at &#39;e_INFO&#39;
:   severity; messages at &#39;e_INFO&#39; severity are ignored by default.
:
: o Depending upon a command-line argument, a message is logged at &#39;e_ERROR&#39;
:   severity, which will be published as a &quot;pass-through&quot;.  If the command-line
:   argument is absent, the program will succeed with no messages published.
:   This is the intended behavior.

 Note that, when logging using the macros, the &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; macro is
 not only extremely convenient, it is required, since it in turn defines
 symbols that the logging macros expect to see.  Note also that
 &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; must be used at function scope.  Finally, note that
 &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; can be used only once within a scope, although it can
 be nested in inner scopes.

 The entire program file is as follows.
..
  // logging.m.cpp                                                    -*-C++-*-

  #include &lt;ball_log.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ball_loggermanager.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ball_loggermanagerconfiguration.h&gt;

  #include &lt;bsl_iostream.h&gt;

  using namespace BloombergLP;

  int main(int argc, char* argv[])
  {
      int verbose = argc &gt; 1;
          // Enable command-line control of program behavior.

      ball_DefaultObserver observer(bsl::cout);
          // Simplest observer; writes to &#39;stdout&#39;.

      ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration configuration;
      configuration.setDefaultThresholdLevelsIfValid(
                                                   ball_Severity::e_BAEL_WARN);
          // Configure the minimum threshold at which records are published to
          // the observer to &#39;e_WARN&#39;.

      ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard scopedGuard(&amp;observer, configuration);
          // Instantiate the logger manager singleton.

      BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY(&quot;main category&quot;);
          // Set a category -- an arbitrary name.

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world!&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;
          // With default settings, this line has no effect.

      if (verbose) {  // &#39;if&#39; to allow command-line activation
          BAEL_LOG_ERROR &lt;&lt; &quot;Good-bye world!&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;
              // Log &#39;message&#39; at &#39;ball_Severity::e_ERROR&#39; severity level.
      }
      else {
          bsl::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This program should produce no other output.\n&quot;;
              // By default, &#39;e_INFO&#39; is ignored; only &#39;e_ERROR&#39; and above are
              // published.
      }

      return 0;
  }
..
 If the above program is run with no command-line arguments, the output will
 appear on &#39;stdout&#39; as:
..
  This program should produce no other output.
..
 This case illustrates the default behavior, namely that &quot;extraordinary&quot;
 severity events (i.e., &#39;e_ERROR&#39; and &#39;e_FATAL&#39;) are published immediately, but
 other events (such as &#39;e_INFO&#39;, &#39;e_DEBUG&#39;, and &#39;e_TRACE&#39;) are ignored.  The
 user can easily modify this default behavior; subsequent examples will address
 these alternate usage modes.

 If, however, any argument at all is provided to the executable on the command
 line, the output to &#39;stdout&#39; will appear something like the following.  (The
 spacing is changed to aid readability.)

/Example 2: Hello World! With Modified Defaults
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This &quot;Hello world!&quot; example illustrates how to enable &quot;recording&quot; log records
 to the in-memory record buffer, and also how to change the severity level at
 which records are published as &quot;pass-through&quot;.  The code is identical to
 {Example 1}, except that attributes of &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; are
 changed from their defaults (in a single line, in this case).

 The &#39;ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration&#39; &#39;setDefaultThresholdLevelsIfValid&#39;
 method, which we will use to change the default configuration, takes four
 arguments, each in the range &#39;[0 .. 255]&#39;.  The method returns a status, and
 will fail (with no effect) if any argument is not a valid threshold level.
 Note that any &#39;ball_Severity::Level&#39; enumerator value is valid, and it is good
 practice to limit arguments to one of those enumerators.  The one line that
 effects our change is:
..
  configuration.setDefaultThresholdLevelsIfValid(
                               ball_Severity::e_TRACE,   // record level
                               ball_Severity::e_WARN,    // pass-through level
                               ball_Severity::e_ERROR,   // trigger level
                               ball_Severity::e_FATAL);  // trigger-all level
..
 This method call sets the four severity threshold levels as indicated, which
 has the following effect on logging behavior.

: 1 Any record logged with a severity that is at least that of &#39;e_TRACE&#39; is
:   written to the record buffer, but not necessarily published.
:
: 2 Any record logged with a severity that is at least that of &#39;e_WARN&#39; is
:   published immediately as a pass-through record *and* is recorded in the
:   record buffer.  Note that, should the record buffer be published before
:   such a record is overwritten, the record will be published a second time,
:   avoiding &quot;holes&quot; in the trace-back if and when the buffer is published.
:
: 3 Any record logged with a severity that is at least that of &#39;e_ERROR&#39; is
:   published immediately as a pass-through record *and* is recorded in the
:   record buffer, and *then* triggers the publication of the record buffer.
:   This behavior, among other things, guarantees that the &#39;e_ERROR&#39; record
:   will be published twice.  Although this might seem like a bug, it is the
:   intended behavior.  Each published record is sent to the observer with a
:   publication cause (a &#39;ball_Transmission::Cause&#39; value), which the observer
:   is free to use in filtering and re-routing published records.  Future
:   examples will illustrate various filtering techniques.
:
: 4 Any record logged with a severity that is at least that of &#39;e_FATAL&#39; will
:   behave as for &#39;e_ERROR&#39; above, except that the record buffer from *every*
:   active logger registered with the logger manager will be published.  See
:   the multi-threaded examples below for more information about multiple
:   loggers.

 With the one extra line of code as described above, plus the explicit
 &#39;#include&#39; directive of &#39;ball_severity.h&#39; (since we use symbols from that
 header explicitly), the code is otherwise exactly as in {Example 1} above.

      }

      return 0;
  }
..
 Once again, if the program is run with no command-line arguments, the output
 will appear on &#39;stdout&#39; as:
..
   This program should produce no other output.

 Now, however, if a command-line argument is provided, the output is a little
 more extensive.  (The spacing is changed to aid readability, and the
 timestamps are altered for illustrative purposes to show the temporal sequence
 more clearly).

..
 Notice that the &#39;e_ERROR&#39; message appears twice.  This is not a bug but, as
 mentioned above, an intended consequence of the settings.  As described above,
 the sequence of events is as follows: (1) The &#39;e_INFO&#39; message is written to
 an in-memory buffer but *not* published (because &#39;e_INFO&#39; is above the
 &quot;Record&quot; threshold but below the &quot;Pass-Through&quot;, &quot;Trigger&quot;, and &quot;Trigger-All&quot;
 thresholds).  (2) The (one) &#39;e_ERROR&#39; message is *first* published (a
 relatively quick operation insuring that the error indication is seen) because
 &#39;e_ERROR&#39; is above the &quot;Pass-Through&quot; threshold, and *then* is written to the
 in-memory buffer, because &#39;e_ERROR&#39; is above the &quot;Record&quot; threshold.  Then,
 the entire contents of the in-memory buffer is published, in &quot;Last In, First
 Out&quot; (LIFO) order, because &#39;e_ERROR&#39; is at the &quot;Trigger&quot; threshold.

/Example 3: Hello World! With Manual &#39;publish&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This &quot;Hello world!&quot; example alters {Example 2} in one aspect.  The conditional
 &#39;e_ERROR&#39; message is removed, as is the use of command-line arguments, since
 they are not needed to illustrate our point.  Instead, the user calls the
 &#39;publish&#39; method of the logger instance &quot;manually&quot; before exiting, to force
 the publication of all unpublished messages in the logger&#39;s buffer.  Note that
 this is not &quot;default&quot; behavior, but is accomplished simply enough.  The line:
..
  manager.getLogger().publish();
..
 uses the singleton logger manager instance to obtain the default logger
 instance, and with that logger instance invokes the &#39;publish&#39; method.  Note
 that the logger&#39;s &quot;manual&quot; &#39;publish&#39; method should not be confused with the
 &#39;ball_Observer&#39; &#39;publish&#39; method, which is invoked by all &quot;manual&quot; and
 &quot;automatic&quot; logger &quot;publishing&quot; operations.  Note also that should the
 &#39;manager&#39; instance for some reason not be visible, the class method
 &#39;ball_LoggerManager::singleton()&#39; can be used to obtain a reference to that
 instance.  The full program file appears as follows.

                                ball_Severity::e_FATAL);  // trigger-all level
          // Set the four severity threshold levels; note that this method can
          // fail, and therefore returns a status.

      ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard scopedGuard(&amp;observer, configuration);
          // Instantiate the logger manager singleton.

      BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY(&quot;main category&quot;);
          // Set a category -- an arbitrary name.

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world!&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello again, world!&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;

      bsl::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;We&#39;re almost ready to exit.&quot;     &quot; &quot;
                   &quot;Let&#39;s publish the buffer first:&quot; &quot;\n&quot;;

      ball_LoggerManager&amp; manager = ball_LoggerManager::singleton();
      manager.getLogger().publish();
          // This chain of calls insures that all messages that are still held
          // in the logger&#39;s in-memory buffer are published before the program
          // terminates.

      return 0;
  }
..
 This program produces the following output on &#39;stdout&#39;, altered here again in
 spacing format and timestamp value for ease of reading.
..
  We&#39;re almost ready to exit.  Let&#39;s publish the buffer first:

  27SEP2007_13:32:17.778 13702 1 INFO logging.m.cpp 37 main category
  Hello again, world!

  27SEP2007_13:32:17.778 13702 1 INFO logging.m.cpp 35 main category
  Hello world!
..
 Note again that the output is published in LIFO order.

/Example 4: Hello World! in Three Files
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This example adds a few new aspects to the scenario of {Example 1} and
 {Example 2}.  First of all, in addition to the file defining &#39;main&#39;, we
 introduce a separate translation unit &#39;f_log.cpp&#39; that defines a function
 &#39;logThisInfoMsg&#39;.  The &#39;f_log.cpp&#39; file defines its own category, &quot;function
 category&quot;, which is distinct from the &quot;main category&quot; defined in &#39;main&#39;.  When
 &#39;logThisInfoMsg&#39; is invoked, the resulting message is logged to &quot;function
 category&quot;.  Note, however, that when the now-familiar logging macros are used
 from &#39;main&#39; directly, those messages are logged to &quot;main category&quot;.

 In addition to the above, we also show another way to alter the default
 thresholds.  In this case, we choose values so that all messages logged with a
 severity at least that of &#39;e_INFO&#39; are passed through immediately to the
 observer (in this case, to &#39;stdout&#39;).  In this example, we make the change by
 calling the &#39;setDefaultThresholdLevels&#39; method of the logger manager:
..
  manager.setDefaultThresholdLevels(
                   ball_Severity::e_TRACE,   // sets &quot;Record&quot; threshold
                   ball_Severity::e_INFO,    // sets &quot;Pass-Through&quot;  threshold
                   ball_Severity::e_ERROR,   // sets &quot;Trigger&quot; threshold
                   ball_Severity::e_FATAL);  // sets &quot;Trigger-All&quot; threshold
..
 The above call has an effect that differs subtly from the configuration
 object&#39;s &#39;setDefaultThresholdLevelsIfValid&#39; method.  The latter sets the
 permanent &quot;factory defaults&quot; as well as the &quot;instantaneous defaults&quot;, which
 may be altered as often as desired using the above call.  If, after the above
 call is made, the &#39;setCategoryThresholdsToFactoryDefaults&#39; method is called,
 the effects of &#39;setDefaultThresholdLevels&#39; are erased.  This distinction is
 important for more advanced administration, but is not central to this
 example; we offer the alternative to illustrate logger functionality.

 Note that it is both unnecessary and a *fatal* *error* for &#39;f_log&#39; (or *any*
 library code) to instantiate a logger manager.  The logger manager is a
 singleton, and should be constructed using the logger manager scoped guard
 (&#39;ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard&#39;).  In any sound design, this should be done
 in &#39;main&#39; before any other threads have been created.

 The main &#39;logging.m.cpp&#39; file, plus &#39;f_log.cpp&#39; and its associated &#39;f_log.h&#39;
 file, are shown below.  First the &#39;f_log.h&#39; header file:
..
  // f_log.h                                                          -*-C++-*-
  #ifndef INCLUDED_F_LOG
  #define INCLUDED_F_LOG

  namespace BloombergLP {

  void logThisInfoMsg(const char* message);
      // Log the specified &#39;message&#39; at the &#39;ball_Severity::e_INFO&#39; severity
      // level.  The category to which &#39;message&#39; is logged is defined in
      // the implementation.  Note that this function may affect the
      // operation of other logging operations that do not explicitly set
      // their own categories.

  }  // close enterprise namespace

  #endif
..
 Then the &#39;f_log.cpp&#39; implementation file:
..
  // f_log.cpp                                                        -*-C++-*-

  #include &lt;ball_log.h&gt;

  namespace BloombergLP {

  void logThisInfoMsg(const char* message)
  {
      // Implementation Note: The uppercase symbols are macros and not
      // functions.  They do not need the terminal &#39;;&#39;, which is provided for
      // readability only.

      BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY(&quot;function category&quot;);
          // Set a category -- arbitrary and may be changed.

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;
          // Log &#39;message&#39; at &#39;ball_Severity::e_INFO&#39; severity level.
  }

  }  // close enterprise namespace
..
 Finally, the &#39;logging.m.cpp&#39; file, which defines &#39;main&#39;:
..
  // logging.m.cpp                                                    -*-C++-*-

      int verbose = argc &gt; 1;
          // Enable command-line control of program behavior.

      ball_DefaultObserver observer(bsl::cout);
          // simplest observer; writes to &#39;stdout&#39;

      ball_LoggerManagerConfiguration configuration;
          // Instantiate the default configuration.

      ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard scopedGuard(&amp;observer, configuration);
          // Instantiate the logger manager singleton.

      ball_LoggerManager&amp; manager = ball_LoggerManager::singleton();
      manager.setDefaultThresholdLevels(

                     ball_Severity::e_FATAL);  // sets &quot;Trigger-All&quot; threshold

      BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY(&quot;main category&quot;);
          // Set a category -- note that this will *not* affect the category
          // set in &#39;logThisInfoMsg&#39;.

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; &quot;Called directly from &#39;main&#39;&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;
          // Logged to &quot;main category&quot;.

      if (verbose) {  // &#39;if&#39; to allow command-line activation
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
              logThisInfoMsg(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
              bsl::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Watch the loop execute:  i = &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; bsl::endl;
                  // proves Msg is published as &quot;pass-through&quot;
          }
      }

      BAEL_LOG_INFO &lt;&lt; &quot;Called again directly from &#39;main&#39;&quot; &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END;
          // Logged to &quot;main category&quot;.

      return 0;
  }
..
 Building these two files and running the executable with no additional
 command-line arguments produces output from the two direct logging calls only.
 Once again, the format and timestamps are altered for readability.
..
  27SEP2007_13:35:33.356 9427 1 INFO logging.m.cpp 40 main category

..
 Note that this sequence is not in LIFO order since this output is not from the
 message buffer, but rather is direct &quot;Pass-Through&quot; output.

 If we provide a command-line argument, which will cause the &#39;for&#39; loop to
 execute, we then get the following output (with formats and timestamps altered
 as is now familiar in these examples).

/Example 5: Logging in Two Threads
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This example illustrates how to use logging in a multi-threaded application.
 Since we have already shown how logging works seamlessly across multiple
 translation units, we will implement everything that we need for this example
 in a single file named &#39;mtlogging1.cpp&#39;.

 We define two functions, &#39;f1&#39; and &#39;f2&#39;, that log their &#39;message&#39; text argument
 to function-defined categories, at &#39;e_INFO&#39; and &#39;e_WARN&#39; severities,
 respectively.  We also define two &#39;extern&#39; &quot;C&quot; thread functions,
 &#39;threadFunction1&#39; and &#39;threadFunction2&#39;, that call &#39;f1&#39; and &#39;f2&#39;,
 respectively, in a loop of three iterations.  The thread functions also differ
 slightly in their calls to &#39;bcemt_ThreadUtil::sleep&#39; within the loop.  These
 &#39;sleep&#39; calls, in conjunction with the logged timestamps, show the interleaved
 operation of the threads.  Note that although the thread functions define
 their own categories, the logging macros in &#39;f1&#39; and &#39;f2&#39; use only the
 category defined within the scope of &#39;f1&#39; and &#39;f2&#39;, respectively.

 &#39;main&#39; creates an observer that will write to &#39;stdout&#39;, initializes the logger
 manager singleton, sets a category, and sets the default threshold values,
 just as in the single-threaded examples above.  Then &#39;main&#39; uses &#39;bcemt&#39; to
 spawn two threads running the above two thread functions.  Each thread logs
 its messages, but only the second thread&#39;s log messages having &#39;e_WARN&#39;
 severity will be published immediately as &quot;Pass-Through&quot; records.  Finally,
 using the same &#39;verbose&#39; mechanism (set by the presence or absence of a
 command-line argument) as the above examples, we conditionally log a message
 in &#39;main&#39; at &#39;e_ERROR&#39; severity.  If this block of code executes, then the
 entire record buffer for the example (i.e., for both threads and &#39;main&#39;) will
 be published, in reverse chronological order.

 The full code as described above is presented without interruption for ease of
 reading.

 record itself to be published (from thread 1, the &#39;main&#39; thread, as a
 &quot;pass-through&quot;), and it also triggers the publication of the entire record
 buffer.  Note how the records from threads 1, 2, and 3 are published in

/Example 6: Logging in Two Threads Using Two Loggers
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This example is similar to {Example 5} above, with only a few &quot;minor&quot; changes.
 Nevertheless, as we use more of the logger&#39;s features, we need to become more
 familiar with the details of logger operation.  In this example, we install a
 distinct logger instance (i.e., not the default logger) for one of the
 threads.  (The other thread continues to use the default logger, which is
 shared with &#39;main&#39;, to make clear that the &quot;one-logger-per-thread&quot; usage
 pattern applies on a thread-by-thread basis, and is not &quot;all-or-nothing&quot;.)  By
 choosing this more sophisticated usage, however, we need to address the
 question of logger resource management and lifetime -- a question that is
 completely avoided by using the default logger.  As is often the case in
 programming, there is no one &quot;right&quot; answer to this resource question, and so
 we will discuss our choices and the alternatives in this example.

 Installing a distinct logger instance in &#39;threadFunction1&#39; is simple enough to
 do, but a question arises immediately: who should own the logger resources?
 Before we discuss this question, let&#39;s look at the specific solution that we
 have chosen, which will clarify the question of what resources a logger needs.

 We&#39;ve modified &#39;threadFunction1&#39; to take as an argument a logger (which is
 passed as a &#39;void*&#39;) and to use the logger manager&#39;s &#39;setLogger&#39; function to
 install the logger as the active logger for that thread.  The code to do this
 in &#39;threadFunction1&#39; is straightforward:
..
  extern &quot;C&quot; void *threadFunction1(void *logger)
      // ...
  {
      // ...
      ball_LoggerManager::singleton().setLogger((ball_Logger*)logger);
          // Install a local &#39;logger&#39; for this thread.
      // ...
  }
..
 Clearly, in this solution, &#39;threadFunction1&#39; does *not* own &#39;logger&#39; or any of
 its resources.  This *must* be the case, because the function has no way of
 knowing in how many other threads the passed-in &#39;logger&#39; might be installed.
 Recall that any one logger may be installed in any number of threads.

 This one-line addition to call the &#39;setLogger&#39; method is, from the thread
 function&#39;s perspective, the only change needed if the thread is *not* to
 manage its own logger resources.  But if &#39;threadFunction1&#39; does not manage the
 logger resources, then &#39;main&#39; must do so.  Let&#39;s look at what &#39;main&#39; needs to
 do so that we can be concrete about what resources are needed in the first
 place.

 Several steps are needed to instantiate a &#39;ball_Logger&#39; instance.  The logger
 needs a (concrete) &#39;ball_RecordBuffer&#39;, and the preferred record buffer,
 &#39;ball_FixedSizeRecordBuffer&#39;, in turn needs a size for the record buffer
 (&#39;LOGBUF_SIZE&#39;).  We also provide an explicit &#39;bdema_Allocator&#39; to supply
 memory; the default allocator returned by &#39;bdema_Default::defaultAllocator()&#39;
 is sufficient here.  Assuming that 32k bytes is a good size for the buffer,
 the following eight lines will appear in &#39;main&#39;.
..
  enum { LOGBUF_SIZE = 32 * 1024 };
  bdema_Allocator            *alloc_p = bdema_Default::defaultAllocator();
  ball_FixedSizeRecordBuffer  rb(LOGBUF_SIZE, alloc_p);
  ball_LoggerManager&amp;         manager = ball_LoggerManager::singleton();
  ball_Logger                *logger  = manager.allocateLogger(&amp;rb);
  // ...
  manager.deallocateLogger(logger);  // free resources
..
 The last two lines free resources and are executed just before &#39;main&#39; returns.

 With this implementation choice, &#39;main&#39; clearly owns &#39;logger&#39;s resources.  We
 now have enough information to address the question of what the consequences
 of this decision are, and whether or not &#39;main&#39; actually *should* own these
 resources.

 At first glance, it might seem that the thread itself should own and manage
 everything it needs for its own logger.  This is certainly a reasonable
 choice, and {Example 6} below shows what &#39;threadFunction1&#39; would look like in
 that case, but there are two separate reasons why the owner of &#39;main&#39; might
 prefer *not* to delegate those responsibilities to the thread function.

 The first reason -- not relevant in this particular example -- is that &#39;main&#39;
 may wish to install the *same* logger in several threads.  In this case, no
 one thread can manage &quot;its own&quot; logger, because the logger is (or at least
 might be) shared.  Sharing loggers among groups of threads is at least a
 reasonable design choice, and so it is useful to see how &#39;main&#39; takes
 ownership of logger resources.

 The second reason for wanting &#39;main&#39; and not the thread function to own the
 logger&#39;s resources is illustrated -- albeit trivially -- in this example:
 &#39;main&#39; can *potentially* log a &#39;e_FATAL&#39; record (here the &quot;Trigger-All&quot;
 threshold) after all other threads have terminated.  If the user wants the
 (now-terminated) thread&#39;s trace-back log to be published by the &quot;Trigger-All&quot;,
 then &#39;main&#39; must preserve the logger resources.  Otherwise, if a thread were
 to own its own logger resources, then any &quot;trace-back&quot; records generated by
 that thread would necessarily be discarded (or, at best, unconditionally
 published) when the thread function returned.

 In this example we also made a trivial change that has nothing to do with
 threading, but illustrates a useful feature of &#39;ball_DefaultObserver&#39;, namely
 that an instance can write to a file as easily as to &#39;stdout&#39;.  The three
 lines in &#39;main&#39;:
..
  bsl::ofstream outFile(&quot;outFile&quot;);
  ball_DefaultObserver observer(outFile);  // writes to &quot;outFile&quot;
  // ...
  ball_LoggerManagerScopedGuard scopedGuard(&amp;observer, configuration);
                                           // instantiate
..
 install a &quot;file observer&quot; that will write to &quot;outFile&quot;, creating the file if
 it doesn&#39;t exist and overwriting it if it does.  Clearly, this is just taking
 advantage of the standard C++ &#39;ofstream&#39; class, but it is useful all the same.

 The full code as described above is presented without interruption for ease of
 reading.

 Running the above program with no extra command-line argument produces the
 output shown below, which in this example is written to &#39;outFile&#39;.  Note that,
 except for the timestamps, process id, and file name, the output is the same
 as for {Example 5} above: only the &#39;e_WARN&#39; records (from thread 3) are
 published, and that they are in chronological order.

..
 When we supply an additional command-line argument, causing the logging macro
 in &#39;main&#39; (now &#39;BAEL_LOG_FATAL&#39;) to execute, the *initial* output is similar
 to {Example 5}.  Specifically, the three &#39;e_WARN&#39; records are published in
 chronological order as &quot;Pass-Through&quot; records, as is the &#39;e_FATAL&#39; record,
 (which now replaces the &#39;e_ERROR&#39; record).  From here on, however, the
 sequence of events is a bit different.

 Recall that in this example &#39;e_FATAL&#39; is the &quot;Trigger-All&quot; threshold level.
 For a &quot;Trigger-All&quot;, each record buffer is published in turn.  *Within* a
 record buffer, records are published in reverse chronological order, but, as
 can clearly be seen from the timestamps, the sequence of records as a whole is
 not well ordered in time at all.  Note, rather, that the &#39;e_FATAL&#39; and
 &#39;e_WARN&#39; records from the default logger are published in reverse
 chronological order, and *then* the &#39;e_INFO&#39; records from the installed
 &#39;logger&#39; are published in reverse chronological order.

 This example is almost identical to {Example 6} above, except that the eight
 lines (as highlighted above) that are needed to manage resources are moved

 Therefore, we show only &#39;threadFunction1&#39; and &#39;main&#39; explicitly in this

 When the above program is run with a command-line argument, causing the

 but desired behavior chosen by the programmer.  The output is as follows.

/Appendix: Macro Reference
/-------------------------
 This section documents the preprocessor macros defined in &#39;ball_log&#39;.

 The following two macros establish the logging context required by the other
 macros.  A use of one of these two macros must be visible from within the
 lexical scope where the C++ stream-based and &#39;printf&#39;-style macros are used:

: &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY(CATEGORY)&#39;:
:   Set the category for logging to the specified &#39;CATEGORY&#39; (assumed to be of
:   type convertible to &#39;const char *&#39;).  Note that this macro must be used at
:   block scope and can be used at most once in any given block (or else a
:   compiler diagnostic will result).  Also note that this macro invokes the
:   &#39;ball_Log::setCategory&#39; method to retrieve the address of an appropriate
:   category structure for its scope.  (See the function- level documentation
:   of &#39;ball_Log::setCategory&#39; for more information.)  Also note that the
:   category is set only on the *first* invocation of this macro in a code
:   block; subsequent invocations will use a cached address of the category.
:
: &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_DYNAMIC_CATEGORY(CATEGORY)&#39;:
:   Set, *on each invocation*, the category for logging to the specified
:   &#39;CATEGORY&#39;.  This macro is identical to &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; in scoping,
:   parameter, and use of the &#39;ball_Log::setCategory&#39; method.  However, the
:   address returned from &#39;ball_Log::setCategory&#39; is not cached for subsequent
:   calls.  Use this macro to create categories that depend on run-time values
:   (e.g., LUW or uuid).

 The seven macros based on C++ streams, &#39;BAEL_LOG_TRACE&#39;, &#39;BAEL_LOG_DEBUG&#39;,
 &#39;BAEL_LOG_INFO&#39;, &#39;BAEL_LOG_WARN&#39;, &#39;BAEL_LOG_ERROR&#39;, &#39;BAEL_LOG_FATAL&#39;, and
 &#39;BAEL_LOG_END&#39;, have the following usage pattern:
..
  BAEL_LOG_TRACE &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
  BAEL_LOG_DEBUG &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
  BAEL_LOG_INFO  &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
  BAEL_LOG_WARN  &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
  BAEL_LOG_ERROR &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
  BAEL_LOG_FATAL &lt;&lt; X &lt;&lt; Y ... &lt;&lt; BAEL_LOG_END
      where X, Y, ... represents any sequence of values for which
      &#39;operator&lt;&lt;&#39; is defined.  The resulting formatted message string is
      logged with the severity indicated by the name of the initial macro
      (e.g., &#39;BAEL_LOG_TRACE&#39; ... &#39;BAEL_LOG_END&#39; logs with severity
      &#39;ball_Severity::e_TRACE&#39;).  Note that the formatted string includes the
      category and filename as established by the &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; (or
      &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_DYNAMIC_CATEGORY&#39;) and &#39;__FILE__&#39; macros, respectively.
..
 The remaining macros are based on &#39;printf&#39;-style format specifications:
..
  BAEL_LOG0_TRACE(MSG)
  BAEL_LOG0_DEBUG(MSG)
  BAEL_LOG0_INFO (MSG)
  BAEL_LOG0_WARN (MSG)
  BAEL_LOG0_ERROR(MSG)
  BAEL_LOG0_FATAL(MSG)
      Log the specified &#39;MSG&#39; (assumed to be of type convertible to
      &#39;const char *&#39;) with the severity indicated by the name of the macro
      (e.g., &#39;BAEL_LOG0_DEBUG&#39; logs with severity &#39;ball_Severity::e_DEBUG&#39;).
      Note that the formatted message string includes the category and
      filename as established by the &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; (or
      &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_DYNAMIC_CATEGORY&#39;) and &#39;__FILE__&#39; macros, respectively.

  BAEL_LOG1_TRACE(MSG, ARG1)
  BAEL_LOG1_DEBUG(MSG, ARG1)
  BAEL_LOG1_INFO (MSG, ARG1)
  BAEL_LOG1_WARN (MSG, ARG1)
  BAEL_LOG1_ERROR(MSG, ARG1)
  BAEL_LOG1_FATAL(MSG, ARG1)
      Format the specified &#39;ARG1&#39; according to the &#39;printf&#39;-style format
      specification in the specified &#39;MSG&#39; (assumed to be of type convertible
      to &#39;const char *&#39;) and log the resulting formatted message string with
      the severity indicated by the name of the macro (e.g., &#39;BAEL_LOG1_WARN&#39;
      logs with severity &#39;ball_Severity::e_WARN&#39;).  Note that the formatted
      string includes the category and filename as established by the
      &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; (or &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_DYNAMIC_CATEGORY&#39;) and
      &#39;__FILE__&#39; macros, respectively.  The behavior is undefined unless
      &#39;ARG1&#39; is compatible with its corresponding format specification in
      &#39;MSG&#39;.

  BAEL_LOGn_TRACE(MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)     2 &lt;= n &lt;= 9
  BAEL_LOGn_DEBUG(MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
  BAEL_LOGn_INFO (MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
  BAEL_LOGn_WARN (MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
  BAEL_LOGn_ERROR(MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
  BAEL_LOGn_FATAL(MSG, ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
      Format the specified &#39;ARG1&#39;, &#39;ARG2&#39;, ..., &#39;ARGn&#39; (2 &lt;= n &lt;= 9)
      according to the &#39;printf&#39;-style format specification in the specified
      &#39;MSG&#39; (assumed to be of type convertible to &#39;const char *&#39;) and log the
      resulting formatted message string with the severity indicated by the
      name of the macro (e.g., &#39;BAEL_LOG8_FATAL&#39; logs with severity
      &#39;ball_Severity::e_FATAL&#39;).  Note that the formatted string includes the
      category and filename as established by the &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_CATEGORY&#39; (or
      &#39;BAEL_LOG_SET_DYNAMIC_CATEGORY&#39;) and &#39;__FILE__&#39; macros, respectively.
      The behavior is undefined unless each &#39;ARGn&#39; is compatible with its
      corresponding format specification in &#39;MSG&#39;.
