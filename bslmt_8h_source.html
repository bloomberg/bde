@PURPOSE: Support for multi-threading and thread-safe processes.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Multi-Threading (bslmt)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bslmt&#39; package supports primitives that allow creation and
 management of operating system threads.  Using the components in &#39;bslmt&#39;,
 clients can write efficient, thread-safe code.

 Thread creation and management of mutually exclusive locks (mutexes) are
 supported in a way that should be familiar to developers with experience
 programming in threads on any common computing platform.  In addition,
 individual components such as &#39;bslmt_lockguard&#39; and &#39;bslmt_barrier&#39; manage
 synchronization concerns through simple, idiomatic object interfaces that make
 client code easy to read and understand.

/Hierarchical Synopsis

/Thread Management
/-----------------
 Thread management is done via the utility class &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39; in the
 &#39;bslmt_threadutil&#39; component.  This component presents a platform-independent
 protocol whose operations nonetheless correspond closely to native operations
 on platform-specific threads.  &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39; presents a procedural
 interface -- that is, clients do not instantiate &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39; objects,
 and all methods of &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39; are declared &#39;static&#39;.

 Clients create threads with the functions
 &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil::create(Handle*, ...)&#39;.  On success, these functions yield
 a &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil::Handle&#39; object that provides a lightweight handle for an
 operating systems thread.  Similarly, clients destroy threads for which they
 have a current &#39;Handle&#39; with &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil::terminate(Handle*)&#39;.

 &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39; supports two &#39;create()&#39; functions.  The first function
 simply takes a pointer to a &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil::Handle&#39;; the second function
 takes a &#39;bslmt::ThreadAttributes&#39; object that defines component-specific and
 platform-specific attributes of the created thread.  Platform-specific
 attributes include scheduling policy and priority, and thread stack size.  See
 the &#39;bslmt_threadattributes&#39; component documentation for details.

/Thread Synchronization
/----------------------
 The &#39;bslmt&#39; package contains several components and classes that support
 thread synchronization in a number of ways.

/Basic Mutexes: &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39; and &#39;bslmt::RecursiveMutex&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 At the lowest level, synchronization between threads is done with
 &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39;, a type defined in component &#39;bslmt_mutex&#39;.  Locks are
 acquired with &#39;bslmt::Mutex::lock()&#39; or &#39;bslmt::Mutex::tryLock()&#39;, and
 released with &#39;bslmt::Mutex::unlock()&#39;.  The &#39;bslmt&#39; package provides several
 other mechanisms for synchronization and communication, which suit specific
 synchronization problems and allow more idiomatic C++ coding.

 &#39;bslmt::RecursiveMutex&#39; is similar to &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39;, except that it can be
 &#39;lock&#39;ed multiple times *in* *a* *single* *thread*.  A corresponding number of
 calls to &#39;unlock()&#39; are required to unlock the mutex.  &#39;bslmt::RecursiveMutex&#39;
 is defined in component &#39;bslmt_recursivemutex&#39;.

/Inter-thread Condition Variables: &#39;bslmt::Condition&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The &#39;bslmt::Condition&#39; class, defined in component &#39;bslmt_condition&#39;,
 implements a &quot;condition variable&quot; that can be used by multiple threads to
 communicate changes in the condition.  Multiple threads wait on the condition
 by calling &#39;myCondition-&gt;wait(bslmt::Mutex*)&#39;, suspending their execution and
 waiting.  An individual thread then signals when the condition is met by
 calling either &#39;myCondition-&gt;signal()&#39; (waking up a single waiting thread) or
 &#39;myCondition-&gt;broadcast()&#39; (waking up all waiting threads).  Waits with
 timeouts are supported through &#39;bslmt::Condition::timedWait()&#39;.

/Locking/Unlocking Critical Code
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Code in multiple threads can create a &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39; and call &#39;mutex-&gt;lock()&#39;
 and &#39;mutex-&gt;unlock()&#39; to guarantee exclusive access to critical sections of
 code.  A more idiomatic usage is provided by &#39;bslmt::LockGuard&#39; and
 &#39;bslmt::UnLockGuard&#39;; objects of these types themselves lock and unlock a
 &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39; when they are created or destroyed, allowing clients to manage
 mutex locks in a way more transparent, safer way, and also making sure the
 lock is released when an exception is thrown within the critical section.
..
  static void myThreadsafeFunction(myObject *obj, bslmt::Mutex *mutex)
  {
      // creating the &#39;LockGuard&#39;, &#39;guard&#39;, calls &#39;mutex-&gt;lock()&#39;
      bslmt::LockGuard&lt;bslmt::Mutex&gt; guard(mutex);
      if (someCondition) {
          obj-&gt;someMethod();
          return;
          // &#39;guard&#39; is destroyed; this calls &#39;mutex-&gt;unlock()&#39;
      } else if (someOtherCondition) {
          obj-&gt;someOtherMethod();
          return;
          // &#39;guard&#39; is destroyed; this calls &#39;mutex-&gt;unlock()&#39;
      }
      obj-&gt;defaultMethod();
      return;
      // &#39;guard&#39; is destroyed; this calls &#39;mutex-&gt;unlock()&#39;
  }
..

/Thread-Specific Storage
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 Thread-specific storage (also known as thread-local storage, or TLS) is a
 mechanism for referring to a single variable (identified by its &#39;Key&#39; in
 &#39;bslmt::ThreadUtil&#39;, provided by the &#39;bslmt_threadutil&#39; component) whose
 content varies according to the thread it is observed in.  This is useful for
 status variables such as &#39;errno&#39;, which is implemented by the system as a TLS,
 since otherwise it would be impossible to use &#39;errno&#39; values in a thread, not
 knowing if another thread had modified it after the last system call in this
 thread.

/Synchronization of Multiple, Parallel Threads: &#39;bslmt::Barrier&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The &#39;bslmt_barrier&#39; component provides a single class, &#39;bslmt::Barrier&#39;, that
 can be used to synchronize processing among multiple threads.  The
 &#39;bslmt::Barrier&#39; is created with a single argument specifying the number of
 threads to synchronize.  Each individual thread then calls &#39;myBarrier-&gt;wait()&#39;
 when it reaches its synchronization point.  All waiting threads are blocked
 until the required number of threads have called &#39;myBarrier-&gt;wait()&#39;; once the
 required number is reached, the threads are released and can continue
 processing.

/One Writer/Multiple Readers: &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Component &#39;bslmt_readerwriterlock&#39; provides a single class,
 &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock&#39;, that supports multi-reader, single-writer locks.
 Applications can use &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock&#39; to allow concurrent read access
 from multiple threads to data that changes infrequently.  By calling
 &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock::lockRead()&#39;, reading threads are not blocked until a
 writing thread requests a write lock (for instance, by calling
 &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock::lockWrite()&#39;).  While the write lock is in effect,
 access is serialized and all threads that have called &#39;lockRead()&#39; will wait
 until the write lock is released with
 &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock::unlockWrite()&#39;.

 Note that reader/writer locks also have their own guards, provided by
 &#39;bslmt_readlockguard&#39; and &#39;bslmt_writelockguard&#39; components.

/Recursive Write Locks: &#39;bslmt::RecursiveRWLock&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component is *DEPRECATED*.  It can be emulated by a wrapper on a
 &#39;bslmt::ReaderWriterLock&#39; along with a thread-specific counter used to store
 the number of recursive locks acquired by the current thread.

/Static Initialization
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 Initialization of a thread-specific static variable (such as a thread-local
 singleton) can be achieved by using the &#39;bslmt_once&#39; component.  The
 &#39;bslmt_qlock&#39; component ensures thread-safe static initialization of shared
 resources by providing a light-weight, statically initializable lock.  Note
 that the classic &#39;bslmt::Mutex&#39; provided by the &#39;bslmt_mutex&#39; component
 cannot safely be used in static initializations because some platforms (e.g.,
 Windows XP) do not have a native statically-initializable mutex type.

/Implementation Classes and Components
/-------------------------------------
 The &#39;bslmt&#39; package is supported on all Bloomberg platforms.  In order to
 accomplish this, &#39;bslmt&#39; provides platform-specific implementations of thread
 primitives.  The following components provide platform-specific
 implementations:
..
             Component           |                 Purpose
  +==============================+===========================================+
  | bslmt_threadutilimpl_pthread | Template specialization for POSIX threads |
  | bslmt_threadutilimpl_win32   | Template specialization for MS-Windows    |
  +------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
..
 These components are visible and documented.  However, their intended use is
 to support component &#39;bslmt_threadutil&#39;.  Clients should not expect to use
 them directly.
