 This section a brief introduction to the packages of the &#39;bbl&#39; package group.
 See the respective Package Level documents for more details.

/&#39;bbldc&#39;
/- - - -
 The {&#39;bbldc&#39;} package provides day-count convention implementations, an
 enumeration-based set of dispatch components, and two abstract interfaces with
 parameterized adapters for the day-count convention implementations.

/&#39;bblscm&#39;
/ - - - -
 The {&#39;bblscm&#39;} package contains only two components, &#39;bblscm_version&#39; and
 &#39;bblscm_versiontag&#39;.  The first of these components is included by every other
 component in &#39;bbl&#39;, and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the &#39;bblscm_version&#39; facilities to query a particular &#39;bbl&#39;
 library for its version information.  The second component defines macros that
 can be used for conditional-compilation based on &#39;bbl&#39; version information.
