@PURPOSE: Provide implementation mechanisms.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Implementation Mechanisms (bslim)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bslim&#39; package provides implementation mechanisms that are
 typically used to implement functionality provided by other components.  For
 example, &#39;bslim_printer&#39; greatly simplifies the implementation of standard BDE
 &#39;print&#39; methods having this interface:
..
  bsl::ostream&amp; print(bsl::ostream&amp; stream,
                      int           level          = 0,
                      int           spacesPerLevel = 4) const;
..
 The &#39;bslim_testutil&#39; component provides a set of macros that are widely used
 in the test drivers of other BDE components.

/Hierarchical Synopsis

 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
