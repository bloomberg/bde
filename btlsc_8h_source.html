@PURPOSE: Provide abstract interfaces for transport channels and factories.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment Stream-based Channels (btlsc)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;btlsc&#39; package is designed to provide three parallel
 &quot;families&quot; of protocol (i.e., pure abstract interface) for stream-based
 transport: &quot;channel&quot;, &quot;channel allocator&quot;, and &quot;(channel) allocator factory&quot;.
 These three concepts -- clearly closely related -- provide the desired
 factoring of functionality in the concrete objects that implement these
 protocols.  Note that the allocator factories have not yet been released, but
 because they are such a fundamental part of the conceptual factored design of
 &#39;btlsc&#39; the allocator factories are included in the description in this
 section.

 A &quot;channel&quot; is the abstraction of a single endpoint of a communication
 (transport) mechanism.  A channel object that supports various forms of &quot;read&quot;
 and &quot;write&quot; methods, and very little additional functionality.  The intended
 design analogy is to a telephone handset.  One can talk and listen, but
 (almost) all details regarding the transport process itself have been
 abstracted away.  Such matters are of no concern to a channel -- or, more
 importantly, to a channel *user*.

 A &quot;channel allocator&quot; is a dispenser of channel objects.  When a client
 allocates a channel from a channel allocator, the allocator has seen to it
 that the channel is properly configured and ready for use (whatever that might
 mean in a specific implementation).  Still, the channel allocator only
 dispenses one &quot;kind&quot; of channel, i.e., a connection to one specific entity.
 Details of with whom one is communicating have been (profitably) abstracted
 away.  These matters are not the concern of the channel allocator.

 An &quot;allocator factory&quot; is a dispenser of channel allocator objects.  In BDE,
 the terms &quot;allocator&quot; and &quot;factory&quot; are synonymous, but we use the two
 different words for clarity and to avoid any unintentional humor that the
 reduplicative &quot;allocator allocator&quot; might evoke.  The initial &quot;channel&quot;,
 logically a part of the name of this entity, has also been omitted for brevity
 and clarity.  An &quot;allocator factory&quot; is basically a naming service that
 provides a channel allocator in response to a request for a connection to a
 specific entity.

 This factoring allows client designers using concrete objects derived from
 &#39;btlsc&#39; protocols to provide clear and simple objects whose functionality is
 well defined and easy to use at each level of the design.

/Specific Functionality in the Protocol Contracts
/------------------------------------------------
 For each of the three entities described above, channels, channel allocators,
 and allocator factories, there exist specific protocols to support blocking
 and non-blocking objects, and objects that do and do not support timeout
 capability.  To facilitate good design and usage in the concrete
 implementations, each &quot;timed&quot; entity is derived from its &quot;untimed&quot;
 counterpart.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;btlsc&#39; package currently has 9 components having 4 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
