//@PURPOSE: Define the namespace &#39;native_std&#39; as an alias for &#39;::std&#39;.
//
//@CLASSES:
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bsl_stdhdrs_prologue
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component defines a namespace alias, &#39;native_std&#39;, that
// serves as an alias for the &#39;std&#39; namespace.  The &#39;bsl&#39; package group
// contains a Bloomberg implementation of the C++ standard library, which, when
// compiled in bde-stl mode, will override the STL implementation in namespace
// &#39;std&#39;.  With the &#39;native_std&#39; alias, users can refer to the STL types from
// the compiler&#39;s native library, even if the &#39;std&#39; is configured to refer to
// Bloomberg provided STL types.  The &#39;native_std&#39; namespace remains in effect
// even if &#39;std&#39; is redefined as a preprocessor macro.  Note that this
// component is mainly provided for code being compiled in bde-stl mode.
//
// Note: It is safe to &#39;#include&#39; this header only if &#39;std&#39; is not yet defined
// as a macro or if &#39;BSL_DEFINED_NATIVE_STD&#39; is already defined.  Any other
// header that defines the &#39;native_std&#39; namespace should also define the
// &#39;BSL_DEFINED_NATIVE_STD&#39; macro.  For more info on bde-stl mode, please see
// &#39;bsl+stdhdrs/doc/bsl+stdhdrs.txt&#39;.
//
///Usage
///-----
// In the following example we use the &#39;native_std&#39; prefix to access the native
// implementation of &#39;std::string&#39;, even when the compilation is configured to
// override the use of native STL types with Bloomberg provided STL types
// (i.e., bde-stl mode, used by Bloomberg managed code):
//..
//  #include &lt;bsls_nativestd.h&gt;
//  #include &lt;string&gt;
//
//  std::string        s1;  // might be &#39;bsl::string&#39;
//  native_std::string s2;  // guaranteed to be the compiler&#39;s native string
//..

#ifndef INCLUDED_BSLS_PLATFORM
#include &lt;bsls_platform.h&gt;
#endif

// &#39;&lt;bsls_platform.h&gt;&#39; is included early in the header sequence, as it contains
// several macros that control the configuration of the native STL on the
// Windows platform, if no other.  The main reason is to disable Microsoft&#39;s
// deprecation warnings, as they deprecated the entire standard library unless
// certain configuration macros are defined.  We put those macros into our
// common platform header, rather than require the user to supply lots of
// options to every project they create in Visual Studio in order to use BDE.
