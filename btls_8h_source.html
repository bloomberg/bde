@PURPOSE: Provide transport-specific system level services.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment System-level services (btls)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;btls&#39; package provides &quot;system level&quot; services that are
 required by this transport package group in a form that is portable across all
 suported platforms.  Currently, the package supplies objects and utilities to
 implement the Unix &#39;iovec&#39; (&quot;scatter/gather&quot;) buffer structure in a
 platform-neutral form.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;btls&#39; package currently has 5 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
