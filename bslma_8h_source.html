@PURPOSE: Provide allocators, guards, and other memory-management tools.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Memory Allocators (bslma)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bslma&#39; package provides an allocator protocol (i.e., a pure
 abstract interface) and a variety of concrete allocators derived from this
 protocol, as well as other memory-dispensing mechanisms and various guard
 constructs to prevent loss in case of exceptions.  In addition, &#39;bslma&#39; also
 provides a mechanism for installing a &quot;default allocator&quot; that will then be
 visible to all BDE and BDE-compliant code throughout that process.  If this
 mechanism is not invoked explicitly, then an allocator that uses global &#39;new&#39;
 and &#39;delete&#39; is the BDE default allocator.  This topic is discussed in more
 detail below.

/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to some of the components of the
 &#39;bslma&#39; package.  See the documentation in each component for full details.

/&#39;bslma_allocator&#39;
/- - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_allocator&#39;} component defines a protocol (i.e., an abstract base
 class) requiring the following interface: &#39;allocate&#39; for memory allocation,
 and &#39;deallocate&#39;, for allocation and deallocation of individual memory blocks.

/&#39;bslma_autodeallocator&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_autodeallocator&#39;} component provides a range proctor class to
 manage a sequence of blocks of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory of a parameterized
 &#39;TYPE&#39; supplied at construction.  If not explicitly released, the sequence of
 managed memory blocks are deallocated automatically when the range proctor
 goes out of scope by freeing the memory using the parameterized &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39;
 (allocator or pool) supplied at construction.  This proctor mechanism is
 useful in guarding against memory leaks, e.g., when additional allocations may
 throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_autodestructor&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_autodestructor&#39;} component provides a range proctor class to
 manage a sequence of blocks of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory of a parameterized
 &#39;TYPE&#39; supplied at construction.  If not explicitly released, the sequence of
 managed memory blocks are destroyed automatically when the range proctor goes
 out of scope by calling each (managed) object&#39;s destructor.  This proctor
 mechanism is useful in guarding against memory leaks, e.g., when additional
 allocations may throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_autorawdeleter&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_autorawdeleter&#39;} component provides a range proctor class template
 to manage a sequence of (otherwise-unmanaged) objects of parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39;
 supplied at construction.  If not explicitly released, the sequence of managed
 objects are deleted automatically when the range proctor goes out of scope by
 iterating over each object, first calling the (managed) object&#39;s destructor,
 and then freeing its memory footprint by invoking the &#39;deallocate&#39; method of
 an allocator (or pool) of parameterized &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; type also supplied at
 construction.  This proctor mechanism is useful in guarding against memory
 leaks, e.g., when additional allocations may throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_deallocatorguard&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_deallocatorguard&#39;} component provides a guard class template to
 *unconditionally* manage a block of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory.  The managed
 memory is deallocated automatically when the guard object goes out of scope
 using the &#39;deallocate&#39; method of the parameterized &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; (allocator or
 pool) supplied at construction.  This guard mechanism is useful in ensuring
 that a dynamically allocated raw memory resource is safely deallocated in the
 presense of multiple return satements or exceptions.

/&#39;bslma_deallocatorproctor&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_deallocatorproctor&#39;} component provides a proctor class template
 to *conditionally* manage a block of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory.  If not
 explicitly released, the managed memory is deallocated automatically when the
 proctor object goes out of scope by freeing the memory using the parameterized
 &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; (allocator or pool) supplied at construction.  This proctor
 mechanism is useful in guarding against memory leaks, e.g., when additional
 allocations may throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_default&#39;
/- - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_default&#39;} component provides a namespace for a set of utility
 functions that manage the addresses of two static (global) memory allocator
 instances: the *default* allocator and the *global* allocator.  The default
 allocator is the allocator used by default by all BDE components.  The global
 allocator is the allocator used by default to construct global singleton
 objects.  Each of these allocators are of type derived from
 &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;.

/&#39;bslma_defaultallocatorguard&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_defaultallocatorguard&#39;} component provides a mechanism that serves
 as a &quot;scoped guard&quot; to enable the temporary replacement of the process-wide
 default allocator.  This functionality is intended for *testing* only, and in
 no event should this component be used except at the very beginning of &#39;main&#39;.

/&#39;bslma_deleterhelper&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_deleterhelper&#39;} component provides non-primitive procedures used
 to delete objects of parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39; by first calling the destructor of
 the object, and then freeing the memory footprint of the object using a
 parameterized &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; (allocator or pool) provided as a second argument.

/&#39;bslma_destructorguard&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_destructorguard&#39;} component provides a guard class template to
 *unconditionally* manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized
 &#39;TYPE&#39; supplied at construction.  The managed object is destroyed
 automatically when the guard object goes out of scope by calling the (managed)
 object&#39;s destructor.  This guard mechanism is useful in ensuring that a
 dynamically allocated raw memory resource is safely deallocated in the
 presense of multiple return satements or exceptions.

/&#39;bslma_destructorproctor&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_destructorproctor&#39;} component provides a proctor class template to
 *conditionally* manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39;
 supplied at construction.  If not explicitly released, the managed object is
 destroyed automatically when the proctor object goes out of scope by calling
 the object&#39;s destructor.  This proctor mechanism is useful in guarding against
 memory leaks, e.g., when additional allocations may throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_mallocfreeallocator&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_mallocfreeallocator&#39;} component provides a wrapper around
 &#39;std::malloc&#39; and &#39;std::free&#39; that adheres to the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; protocol
 (i.e., provides &#39;allocate&#39; and &#39;deallocate&#39; functions).

/&#39;bslma_newdeleteallocator&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_newdeleteallocator&#39;} component provides a wrapper around
 &#39;operator new&#39; and &#39;operator delete&#39; that adheres to the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;
 protocol (i.e., provides an &#39;allocate&#39; function and a &#39;deallocate&#39; function).

/&#39;bslma_rawdeleterguard&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_rawdeleterguard&#39;} component provides a guard class template to
 *unconditionally* manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized
 &#39;TYPE&#39; supplied at construction.  The managed object is deleted automatically
 when the guard object goes out of scope by first calling the (managed)
 object&#39;s destructor, and then freeing the memory using the parameterized
 &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; (allocator or pool) also supplied at construction.  This guard
 mechanism is useful in ensuring that a dynamically allocated raw memory
 resource is safely deallocated in the presense of multiple return satements or
 exceptions.

/&#39;bslma_rawdeleterproctor&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_rawdeleterproctor&#39;} component provides a proctor class template to
 conditionally manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39;
 supplied at construction.  If not explicitly released, the managed object is
 deleted automatically when the proctor object goes out of scope by first
 calling the (managed) object&#39;s destructor, and then freeing the memory using
 the parameterized &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39; (allocator or pool) also supplied at
 construction.  This proctor mechanism is useful in guarding against memory
 leaks, e.g., when additional allocations may throw an exception.

/&#39;bslma_testallocator&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_testallocator&#39;} component provides an instrumented allocator that
 implements the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; protocol and can be used to track various
 aspects of memory allocated from it.  This allocator memory allocator uses
 global functions &#39;std::malloc&#39; and &#39;std::free&#39; for allocations and
 deallocations.

/&#39;bslma_testallocatorexception&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_testallocatorexception&#39;} component defines an exception object for
 use in testing exceptions during memory allocations.

/&#39;bslma_testallocatormonitor&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {&#39;bslma_testallocatormonitor&#39;} component provides a &quot;monitor&quot;, a mechanism
 class, that allows concise tests of state change (or lack of change) in the
 test allocator provided at the monitor&#39;s construction.

/Why Use Allocators?
/-------------------
 Allocators were originally introduced into STL to provide containers an
 abstraction for the different pointer types on the Intel architecture (such as
 near and far pointers).  After the C++ standard (section 20.1.5 of the 1998
 standard) specified the requirements on an allocator type (&#39;std::allocator&#39;)
 that use was rendered obsolete.  But the standard also specified that all
 standard containers be parameterized on an allocator type that provides users
 greater control over the memory usage of individual objects and allows an
 application to control from where that memory comes (e.g., stack, heap, shared
 memory) and how it is distributed.  By using allocators, an application can
 ensure efficient memory usage by reducing the number of distinct calls to
 global operators &#39;new&#39; and &#39;delete&#39; (and functions &#39;std::malloc&#39; and
 &#39;std::free&#39;).

/Rationale for the BDE Allocator Model
/-------------------------------------
 Although C++ standard allocators (&#39;std::allocator&#39;) provide users great
 control on how containers can allocate memory having a templated allocator
 argument introduces other problems.  Two containers instantiated with
 different allocator types refer to different types making interoperability
 between them difficult and limiting the allocator type to a per-class (as
 opposed to a per-instance) basis.  The standard&#39;s requirement of a templated
 allocator type is limited to containers and does not address other
 user-defined types that allocate memory.  Although users can augment their
 types to take a templated allocator type such use is likely to be tedious and
 to result in significant object code increase.  Finally, the standard is
 unclear with regards to the copy semantics of stateful allocators.

 The BDE allocator model provides a solution to these issues.  BDE provides an
 allocator protocol and concrete allocator implementations that can be passed
 as constructor arguments (not as template parameters) to all objects that
 allocate memory.  The type of an object is unaffected by the passed-in
 allocator and the user has full control over the scope of an allocator
 instance.  As the model specifies a protocol it is easier to create concrete
 implementations and use them.  The allocator model requires all elements (data
 members) of a container (object) to use the same allocator as the container
 (object).  Also the allocator is not transferred on copy construction.

/Allocators and Other Memory-Dispensing Mechanisms
/-------------------------------------------------
 An allocator is a memory manager that derives from the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;
 protocol and provides an &#39;allocate&#39; method for obtaining memory, and a
 &#39;deallocate&#39; method for returning memory (to the allocator).  &#39;bslma&#39; also
 provides many memory-dispensing mechanisms that also provide an &#39;allocate&#39; and
 a &#39;deallocate&#39; method, but these memory managers are not properly referred to
 as &quot;allocators&quot;, since we reserve the term &quot;allocator&quot; for concrete memory
 dispensers that actually derive from &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; and are therefore
 usable anywhere that a &#39;bslma::Allocator *&#39; is specified.  Objects that
 dispense memory but that are not actually &quot;allocators&quot; are sometimes called
 &quot;end-point allocators&quot;, and may offer performance advantages to certain users.
 Choosing an allocation mechanisms is complex, and many factors will influence
 the decision.  The discussions here are aimed at shedding light on this
 important selection process.

 Characteristics differentiating among &#39;bslma&#39; memory-allocation objects *in*
 *general* are:

: o Whether or not the object isA &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;.
:
: o Whether or not the allocator supports memory reuse.
:
: o Whether allocation requests consume the exact amount of memory requested,
:   an additive number of additional bytes, or a non-additive number of
:   additional bytes (e.g., the smallest power of two that can satisfy the
:   request).
:
: o Whether allocation requests consume the exact amount of memory requested,
:
: o Whether or not the allocator supports multi-threading.

 All &#39;bslma&#39; allocators (except &#39;bslma::TestAllocator&#39;) are fully thread-safe
 but not thread-enabled (see the &#39;bsldoc_glossary.h&#39; for terminology).

 The BDE allocators have two more differentiating properties.  First, whether
 the allocator is intended to be part of a chain (or other grouping) of
 allocators, or is an &quot;end-point&quot; allocator.  The former kind support the
 &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; protocol.  &quot;End-point&quot; allocators, such as a memory pool,
 are general-purpose mechanisms designed to minimize the runtime overhead of
 allocation and deallocation on a call-by-call basis and therefore do not
 derive from &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;.  The &#39;bslma&#39; package does not provide any
 end-point allocators although such implementations may be provided in
 higher-level libraries.

 Supporting a common protocol (the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; protocol) allows passing
 conformant allocators to BDE (and other) objects requiring an allocator at
 construction.  Support of this common protocol also facilitates grouping the
 memory used by an object into one allocator.

 The BDE libraries use allocators with all classes requiring dynamic memory
 allocation, allowing clients to fine-tune memory-related performance
 characteristics by replacing the established defaults with client-chosen
 alternatives.  Because the protocol is public, clients can even write their
 own, customized implementations, and use those.  But none of these actions are
 required.  BDE components all work with a (preset) default allocator, and
 clients without special requirements need never concern themselves with
 allocators.

/&#39;Allocator&#39; and &#39;ManagedAllocator&#39;
/----------------------------------
 A differentiating property among &#39;bslma&#39; allocators is whether the allocator
 is a &quot;managed&quot; or &quot;unmanaged&quot; allocator.  Unmanaged allocators, concrete
 implementations of &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;, require every allocation to be matched
 by a deallocation, similar to &#39;malloc&#39; and &#39;free&#39;, or &#39;new&#39; and &#39;delete&#39;.
 Managed allocators, concrete implementations of &#39;bslma::ManagedAllocator&#39;, in
 addition to implementing the &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; protocol, provide simultaneous
 deallocation of all memory with one call to &#39;release&#39;.  This &#39;release&#39;
 optimization can provide significant performance improvements if the only
 system resource held by an object (and all the objects it manages) is memory.
 The &#39;bslma&#39; package does not provide any concrete managed allocator
 implementations although such implementations may be provided in higher-level
 libraries.

/Proctors and Guards
/-------------------
 The &#39;bslma&#39; package contains many components for managing
 dynamically-allocated objects.  These components can be divided along two
 dimensions:

: o What their objects do on destruction: The objects of these managers can
:   either deallocate, destroy, or delete (destroy and then deallocate) the
:   memory or object under management.
:
: o Proctors or Guards: The object managers can be divided into guards that
:   *unconditionally* deallocate, destroy, or delete their managed objects on
:   destruction and proctors that *conditionally* do so.  Proctors provide a
:   &#39;release&#39; method that can be invoked to release their managed objects from
:   management.

 The following table categorizes the various components along these dimensions:

..
                 Deallocation          Destruction          Deletion
             +--------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  Proctor    | DeallocatorProctor | DestructorProctor | RawDeleterProctor |
             +--------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
  Guard      | DeallocatorGuard   | DestructorGuard   | RawDeleterGuard   |
             +--------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
..

 Note that the components named &quot;raw&quot; (&#39;bslma_rawdeleterproctor&#39; and
 &#39;bslma_rawdeleterguard&#39;) should be used only if we are sure that the supplied
 pointer is !not! of a type that is a secondary base class -- i.e., the
 (managed) object&#39;s address is (numerically) the same as when it was originally
 dispensed by &#39;ALLOCATOR&#39;.

 All of the object managers specified above manage an individual object or a
 block of memory but three components, &#39;bslma_autodeallocator&#39;,
 &#39;bslma_autodestructor&#39; and &#39;bslma_autorawdeleter&#39; allow users to manage a
 sequence of objects or memory blocks.

/Alignment
/---------
 Alignment of an *address* in memory refers to the relative position of that
 address with respect to specific (hardware-imposed) boundaries within the
 memory space.  Any one address can be said to be on a one-byte boundary, a
 two-byte boundary, a four-byte boundary, or an eight-byte boundary.  (Clearly,
 this sequence can be extended, but, as of this writing, boundaries beyond
 eight-byte boundaries are not relevant for these discussions on any hardware
 platform of interest.  In particular, &quot;alignment&quot; as we are using the term
 here does not deal with page boundaries or other larger memory structures,
 although these considerations are important elsewhere.)

 In general, we also speak about the alignment of (the *first* *byte* of) an
 entity (e.g., an &#39;int&#39;, a &#39;double&#39;, or a pointer) whose size is not
 necessarily one byte.  As a practical matter, for each entity separately, some
 alignments are &quot;safe&quot; and some are not.  By &quot;not safe&quot; we mean that, for most
 platforms (e.g., all of our Unix machines), attempting to access an entity at
 an address that is not safely aligned for that entity will cause a bus error,
 crashing the program on the spot.  In the very best case, the access will
 incur a performance penalty as the memory is shifted appropriately between its
 initial address and its target address (e.g., a register).

 The BDE memory managers provide three kinds of alignment: NATURAL, MAXIMAL,
 and BYTE -- but note that BYTE alignment is also referred to as &quot;no alignment&quot;
 or &quot;none&quot; in this document, since every address is aligned to *some* byte.

 A C/C++ variable is &quot;naturally aligned&quot; if its size divides the numerical
 value of its address.  An address is &quot;maximally aligned&quot; if it can serve as a
 naturally-aligned address no matter what type of object might be stored there.
 That is, it meets the alignment requirements of the type with the maximally
 restrictive needs.

 Accessing data stored at an aligned address is *faster* on Intel platforms and
 *required* on almost all Unix platforms.  Reading (or writing) a C/C++
 variable at an unaligned address will cause a Bus Error on these Unix
 platforms, and thus crash the program.

 Normally, programmers need not worry about alignment for dynamically allocated
 memory.  The runtime system&#39;s &#39;new&#39; (or &#39;malloc&#39;, for C) automatically return
 memory blocks beginning at maximally-aligned addresses (the C++ standard
 requires it of &#39;new&#39;).  All memory managers in the &#39;bslma&#39; package return
 maximally-aligned memory.

 The cost of obtaining aligned addresses is twofold: an increase in the memory
 used (allocators returning aligned addresses do so by skipping bytes that
 could otherwise be used, so as to return an appropriate address), and
 additional computation time to calculate the needed alignment and subsequent
 offset.

 See the {&#39;bsls_alignment&#39;|Alignment Strategy} component for further
 information on the supported alignment strategies.

/Deallocation
/------------
 Some managers may not deallocate individual items.  (The &#39;deallocate&#39; function
 is almost always provided, but in these managers it performs no action.)  Such
 managers provide a &#39;release&#39; function instead, which relinquishes *all* memory
 allocated by that manager since the previous &#39;release&#39; call.  All memory
 managers in the &#39;bslma&#39; package deallocate the specified memory during a
 &#39;deallocate&#39; method invocation.

/Type and Origination
/--------------------
 Most managers provide variable-sized, untyped (i.e., &#39;void *&#39;) memory.

 Different components manage memory in different ways, but they necessarily
 *obtain* the memory that they manage from one of the two usual sources: the
 heap or the stack.  The &#39;bslma::NewDeleteAllocator&#39; is hard-coded to obtain
 memory from the heap -- its underlying source is &#39;operator new&#39;.

 The managers in the &#39;bslma&#39; package are compared in the following tables:

/The Default Allocator
/---------------------
 All object types in BDE libraries needing dynamic memory require that an
 allocator be passed to their constructor.  They take a &#39;bslma::Allocator *&#39;
 argument, which defaults to the value of &#39;bslma::Default::defaultAllocator()&#39;.
 This value is set by BDE library code to be
 &#39;bslma::NewDeleteAllocator::singleton()&#39;, but it can be changed:
 &#39;bslma::Default::setDefaultAllocator&#39; sets the value of the (global) default
 allocator (although this is *strongly* discouraged), and
 &#39;bslma::Default::allocator&#39; returns it.

/Interaction With Other Packages
/-------------------------------
 All BDE library objects needing dynamic memory require that an allocator be
 passed to their constructor, which defaults to the allocator currently
 installed as the default allocator.

/Usage
/-----
 This section illustrates intended use of components in this package.

/Example 1: Creating a type that uses &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 If objects of a class allocate memory (or contain data members that do) then
 having all constructors of that class accept the address of a
 &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; object as an argument allows its clients to control how
 those objects allocate memory.  An example of this is provided by showing the
 creators of a &#39;Customer&#39; &#39;class&#39; that stores the first and last names of a
 customer as &#39;bsl::string&#39; objects and the various account numbers of that
 customer using a &#39;bsl::vector&#39;.  For simplicity part of the interface is
 elided.
..
                          // ==============
                          // class Customer
                          // ==============

  class Customer {
      // This simply constrained (value-semantic) attribute class represents
      // the information about a bank&#39;s customer.  A customer&#39;s first and last
      // name are represented as &#39;bsl::string&#39; objects, the associated accounts
      // are stored in a &#39;bsl::vector&lt;int&gt;&#39;, and the employee identification
      // number is represented by an &#39;int&#39;.  Note that the class invariants are
      // identically the constraints on the individual attributes.
      //
      // This class:
      //: o supports a complete set of *value-semantic* operations
      //:   o except for &#39;bslx&#39; serialization
      //: o is *exception-neutral* (agnostic)
      //: o is *alias-safe*
      //: o is &#39;const&#39; *thread-safe*

      // DATA
      bsl::string      d_firstName;       // first name
      bsl::string      d_lastName;        // last name
      bsl::vector&lt;int&gt; d_accounts;        // account numbers
      int              d_id;              // customer identification number

    public:
..
 Note that the constructor declarations below all accept the address of a
 &#39;bslma::Allocator&#39; argument.
..
      // CREATORS
      Customer(bslma::Allocator *basicAllocator = 0);
          // Create a &#39;Customer&#39; object having the (default) attribute values:

          //..
          // Optionally specify a &#39;basicAllocator&#39; used to supply memory.  If
          // &#39;basicAllocator&#39; is 0, the currently installed default allocator
          // is used.

      Customer(const bslstl::StringRef&amp;  firstName,
               const bslstl::StringRef&amp;  lastName,
               const bsl::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;   accounts,
               int                       id,
               bslma::Allocator         *basicAllocator = 0);
          // Create a &#39;Customer&#39; object having the specified &#39;firstName&#39;,
          // &#39;lastName&#39;, &#39;accounts&#39;, and &#39;id&#39;&#39; attribute values.  Optionally
          // specify a &#39;basicAllocator&#39; used to supply memory.  If
          // &#39;basicAllocator&#39; is 0, the currently installed default allocator
          // is used.

      Customer(const Customer&amp; original, bslma::Allocator *basicAllocator = 0);
          // Create a &#39;Customer&#39; object having the same value as the specified
          // &#39;original&#39; object.  Optionally specify a &#39;basicAllocator&#39; used to

      //! ~Customer() = default;
          // Destroy this object.

                                    // Aspects

      bslma::Allocator *allocator() const;
          // Return the allocator used by this object to supply memory.  Note
          // that if no allocator was supplied at construction the currently
          // installed default allocator is used.

      ...
  };
..
 Since the &#39;Customer&#39; &#39;class&#39; contains members that allocate memory it can
 associate the &#39;UsesBslmaAllocator&#39; trait defined in the &#39;bslma&#39; package to
 programmatically inform templated code that it uses an allocator.
..

 The constructor implementations of &#39;Customer&#39; can simply forward the
 basicAllocator argument to its data members.  All BSL containers, including

/Example 2: Implementing Templates That May Be Supplied Allocating Types
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 When writing templatized code that may be parameterized on types that allocate
 memory it is often necessary to decide whether to pass through the
 user-supplied allocator to individual objects.  Such code (and containers) can
 use the UsesBslmaAllocator trait defined in the bslma package to decide
 whether to pass the allocator to an object&#39;s constructor.  An example of using
 this trait is provided below by showing a simplified parameterized object pool
 &#39;class&#39;:

..
                          // ================
                          // class ObjectPool

  template &lt;typename TYPE&gt;
  class ObjectPool {
      // This &#39;class&#39; provides a pool of reusable objects of the parameterized
      // &#39;TYPE&#39; and assumes that the parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39; provides a default
      // constructor, a destructor, and a &#39;reset&#39; method.

      // DATA

      TYPE *createObject(bsl::false_type);
          // Construct an object of the specified &#39;TYPE&#39; that *does not*
          // require an allocator to be passed to its constructor.

      TYPE *createObject(bsl::true_type);
          // Construct an object of the specified &#39;TYPE&#39; that *requires* an
          // allocator to be passed to its constructor.

    public:
      // CREATORS
      ObjectPool(bslma::Allocator *basicAllocator = 0);
          // Create an object pool that invokes the default constructor of the
          // parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39; to construct objects.  The optionally

          // &#39;basicAllocator&#39; is 0, the currently installed default allocator

      ~ObjectPool();
          // Destroy this object pool.  All objects created by this pool are

          // pool does not have any free objects then a default-constructed
          // object is allocated and returned.

      void releaseObject(TYPE *object);
          // Return the specified &#39;object&#39; back to this object pool.  Invoke
          // the &#39;reset&#39; method on &#39;object&#39;.

 The &#39;createObject&#39; private methods below allow an object to be created by
 specifying an allocator only if it has the &#39;UsesBslmaAllocator&#39; trait.
