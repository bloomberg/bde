@PURPOSE: Define externalization protocols and provide implementations.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library eXternalization (bslx)

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bslx&#39; package defines (via documentation) the BDEX protocol
 for externalization (i.e., for an &quot;out stream&quot;) and &quot;unexternalization&quot; (i.e.,
 for an &quot;in stream&quot;), and provides concrete byte-array-based stream
 implementations of each kind of stream, including streams for testing.  In
 general, concrete streams must be used in matched pairs, as described in more
 detail below.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The &#39;bslx&#39; package currently has 14 components having 5 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.

/Externalization
/---------------
 Externalization is the process of creating another representation for an
 in-memory object (also referred to as an &quot;in-core&quot; object) that can be, but
 need not be, stored external to processor memory.  Often this is done by
 streaming the object as a sequence (or array) of bytes, sometimes called
 &quot;flattening&quot; the object, because of the one-dimensional structure of a
 sequence or array.  Such flattening allows easy externalization of the object,
 since a byte sequence can be written to a disk file without further
 modification.  It is similarly the native *format* for other externalization
 *mechanisms*, such as OS sockets, and in conjunction with these can be used to
 stream the object outside of processor memory.  Other externalizations include
 storing the relevant data members among various tables and fields of a
 relational database.

 The &#39;bslx&#39; streams provide better support for externalization than &#39;iostream&#39;
 objects because BDEX specifies a canonical, optimized representation for
 fundamental types, provides component authors the tools to externalize in a
 platform-neutral way any in-core object, and allows versioning of types not
 directly supported by BDEX.

 When externalizing data, the version to be used must be supplied to the
 objects directly serialized (objects nested within these &quot;top-level&quot; objects
 obtain their version from the parent object explicitly), and this version is
 typically externalized as well.  Likewise, the unexternalization process
 typically obtains the version information from the data for the top-level
 objects and the implementation of these top-level objects provides the
 corresponding version information for nested objects.

 As such, any implementation of &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39; is required to use only the
 methods provided by the BDEX-compliant stream and the methods defined in
 &#39;bslx::OutStreamFunctions&#39; that require a version to be specified.  For
 externalization of types not needing a version, the value
 &#39;bslx::VersionFunctions::k_NO_VERSION&#39; should be supplied for this parameter.

 However, when using &#39;operator&lt;&lt;&#39; it is impractical to directly supply the
 version to be used with each top-level object.  As such, an indirect method of
 versioning is employed, which incorporates data provided to the stream during
 the stream&#39;s construction, the &#39;versionSelector&#39;.  One requirement of all
 BDEX-compliant serializable types is to implement the
 &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39; method, which converts this &#39;versionSelector&#39; to the
 needed version on a per object-type basis.  While the list of versions
 supported by an object is typically a sequential set of numbers starting with
 1, the &#39;versionSelector&#39; is expected to be formatted as &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot;, a date
 representation.  For example, an integral &#39;versionSelector&#39; value of 20140402
 represents the date 2014/04/02 (April 2, 2014).

 If a top-level object is of a type directly supported by the BDEX-compliant
 stream, no version is externalized for the data.  For the stream-supported
 arrays, no version is externalized and the unexternalization of this data must
 use the corresponding stream-supported array unexternalization method.  All
 &#39;vector&#39; externalizations include a version, which, for directly supported
 types, is explicitly the value 1.  For nested vectors, the most-nested type is
 used to determine the version.  If this type is directly supported by the
 stream, the value 1 is used; otherwise, the &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39; method
 provided for that type is used to obtain the version information.

/Supported Types
/---------------
 The supported types and required content are listed in the table below.  All
 of the fundamental types in the table may be streamed as scalar values or as
 homogeneous arrays.  &#39;bsl::string&#39; is streamed as an &#39;int&#39; representing the
 string&#39;s length and a homogeneous &#39;char&#39; array for the string&#39;s data.  Note
 that &#39;Int64&#39; and &#39;Uint64&#39; denote &#39;bsls::Types::Int64&#39; and
 &#39;bsls::Types::Uint64&#39;, respectively, which in turn are &#39;typedef&#39; names for the
 signed and unsigned 64-bit integer types, respectively, on the host platform:
..
  C++ TYPE          REQUIRED CONTENT OF ANY PLATFORM-NEUTRAL FORMAT
  --------------    -----------------------------------------------
  Int64             64 bits (signed)
  Uint64            64 bits (unsigned)
  int               32 bits (signed)
  unsigned int      32 bits (unsigned)
  short             16 bits (signed)
  unsigned short    16 bits (unsigned)
  char               8 bits (platform-dependent)
  signed char        8 bits (signed)
  unsigned char      8 bits (unsigned)
  double            IEEE standard 8-byte floating-point value
  float             IEEE standard 4-byte floating-point value

  bsl::string       BDE implementation of the STL string class
..
 BDEX also supports compact streaming of integer types.  In particular, 64-bit
 integers can be streamed as 40-, 48-, 56-, or 64-bit values, and 32-bit
 integers can be streamed as 24- or 32-bit values, at the user&#39;s discretion.
 In all cases, the least-significant bytes of the fundamental integer type are
 written to the stream.  Therefore, outputting a signed value may not preserve
 the sign of the original value; it is the user&#39;s responsibility to choose
 output methods appropriate to the data.  On input, however, the non-standard
 bit patterns are sign-extended, so that correctly-written values will always
 be correctly read.

/The BDEX Protocols
/ - - - - - - - - -
 The BDEX protocols are primarily &quot;documentation-only&quot; protocols whereby
 BDEX-compliant value-semantic types and streams each adhere to a published
 documentation standard (this document) in order to interoperate correctly.
 The protocols specify what types that wish to support BDEX streaming must
 provide (three specifically-named methods), and what services the type can
 expect from all compliant streams (various &quot;put&quot; and &quot;get&quot; methods).  In
 addition, BDEX also documents two interfaces, &#39;InStream&#39; and &#39;OutStream&#39;, that
 serve as the &quot;documentation protocols&quot; for input and output streams,
 respectively.

/Requirements for a BDEX-Compliant Class to be Streamable
/--------------------------------------------------------
 In this section we give a brief synopsis of the required member functions for
 a class in order to be BDEX-streamable.  See the &quot;Using BDEX with Your Own
 Class&quot; section below for implementation details.

 The required signatures and typical documentation (some behavioral details may
 be implementation-specific) of the three required methods for a BDEX-compliant
 class are as follows:
..
  // CLASS METHODS
  static int maxSupportedBdexVersion(int versionSelector);
      // Return the maximum valid BDEX format version, as indicated by the
      // specified &#39;versionSelector&#39;, to be passed to the &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39;
      // method.  Note that it is highly recommended that &#39;versionSelector&#39; be
      // formatted as &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot;, a date representation.  Also note that
      // &#39;versionSelector&#39; should be a *compile*-time-chosen value that selects
      // a format version supported by both externalizer and unexternalizer.
      // See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more information on
      // BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

  // MANIPULATORS
  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, int version);
      // Assign to this object the value read from the specified input &#39;stream&#39;
      // using the specified &#39;version&#39; format, and return a reference to
      // &#39;stream&#39;.  If &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid, this operation has no
      // effect.  If &#39;version&#39; is not supported, this object is unaltered and
      // &#39;stream&#39; is invalidated, but otherwise unmodified.  If &#39;version&#39; is
      // supported but &#39;stream&#39; becomes invalid during this operation, this
      // object has an undefined, but valid, state.  Note that no version is
      // read from &#39;stream&#39;.  See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for
      // more information on BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and
      // containers.

  // ACCESSORS
  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp; stream, int version) const;
      // Write the value of this object, using the specified &#39;version&#39; format,
      // to the specified output &#39;stream&#39;, and return a reference to &#39;stream&#39;.
      // If &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid, this operation has no effect.  If
      // &#39;version&#39; is not supported, &#39;stream&#39; is invalidated, but otherwise
      // unmodified.  Note that &#39;version&#39; is not written to &#39;stream&#39;.  See the
      // &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more information on BDEX
      // streaming of value-semantic types and containers.
..

/Selection of Streams
/- - - - - - - - - -
 At present, there are two pairs of concrete BDEX-compliant streams in &#39;bslx&#39;:
..
  Out Stream               In Stream              Informal Designation
  -------------------      ------------------     --------------------
  bslx::ByteOutStream      bslx::ByteInStream     &quot;Production Streams&quot;
  bslx::TestOutStream      bslx::TestInStream     &quot;Test Streams&quot;
..
 The informal designations are used throughout this document.

 In general, the concrete &quot;in streams&quot; and &quot;out streams&quot; must be used in
 matched pairs.  For example, the user should not expect correct behavior if an
 object is externalized to a &#39;bslx::TestOutStream&#39; and then unexternalized from
 a seemingly-appropriately-constructed &#39;bslx::ByteInStream&#39;.  Each pair of
 streams is designed with different aims in mind, and so their exact formats
 may vary.

 The typical user will probably be content to use the production streams for
 most purposes.  We will assume that the production stream is the &quot;correct&quot;
 choice without further explicit discussion in most usage examples.  See the
 individual stream component documentation for specific details about using
 test streams.  The test streams are meant for testing *only*.

/Using BDEX with Your Own Class
/------------------------------
 We will show a very brief example of a fictitious &#39;MyPoint&#39; class whose
 intended purpose is to hold a pair of &#39;int&#39; values representing a point in a
 two-dimensional rectilinear coordinate space.  We will first define the class
 without BDEX support and then add that support.  Note that, in this example,
 most of the required documentation and some required methods and free
 operators are omitted for ease of viewing.

 A simple implementation of &#39;MyPoint&#39; might be:
..
   class MyPoint {
       int d_x;
       int d_y;

     public:
       // CREATORS
       MyPoint() : d_x(0), d_y(0) { }
       MyPoint(int x, int y) : d_x(x), d_y(y) { }
       MyPoint(const MyPoint&amp; original)
         : d_x(original.d_x), d_y(original.d_y) { }
       ~MyPoint() { }

       // MANIPULATORS
       MyPoint&amp; operator=(const MyPoint&amp; rhs)
           { d_x = rhs.d_x;  d_y = rhs.d_y;  return *this; }
       void setX(int x) { d_x = x; }
       void setY(int y) { d_y = y; }

       // ACCESSORS
       int x() const { return d_x; }
       int y() const { return d_y; }
   };
..
 Putting other design decisions to one side for this discussion, we may ask:
 How would we incorporate BDEX streaming into such a class?  We observe that
 the actual data footprint of such a point class is two &#39;int&#39; values.  If BDEX
 succeeds in externalizing these two &#39;int&#39; values (preserving their order),
 then the task is accomplished.

 The function-level documentation should make the purpose of each method clear,
 and we will show the implementations for &#39;MyPoint&#39; soon, but first let&#39;s just
 say a few words about &quot;version&quot;.  In a nutshell, the version is set to 1 in
 the initial release of the class, and in the best of all worlds, the version
 stays 1 forever.  If, however, for some reason the developer wishes to alter
 the BDEX streaming contract (e.g., for some performance reasons), the explicit
 version maintains backward compatibility.

 Adding the three methods to &#39;MyPoint&#39; that are required for BDEX-compliance is
 straightforward:
..
   class MyPoint {
       int d_x;
       int d_y;

     public:
       // CLASS METHODS
       static int maxSupportedBdexVersion(int versionSelector);
           // Return the maximum valid BDEX format version, as indicated by the
           // specified &#39;versionSelector&#39;, to be passed to the &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39;
           // method.  Note that it is highly recommended that
           // &#39;versionSelector&#39; be formatted as &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot;, a date
           // representation.  Also note that &#39;versionSelector&#39; should be a
           // *compile*-time-chosen value that selects a format version
           // supported by both externalizer and unexternalizer.  See the
           // &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more information on BDEX
           // streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

       // CREATORS
       MyPoint() : d_x(0), d_y(0) { }
       MyPoint(int x, int y) : d_x(x), d_y(y) { }
       MyPoint(const MyPoint&amp; original)
         : d_x(original.d_x), d_y(original.d_y) { }
       ~MyPoint() { }

       // MANIPULATORS
       MyPoint&amp; operator=(const MyPoint&amp; rhs)
           { d_x = rhs.d_x;  d_y = rhs.d_y;  return *this; }
       void setX(int x) { d_x = x; }
       void setY(int y) { d_y = y; }

       template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
       STREAM&amp; bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, int version);
           // Assign to this object the value read from the specified input
           // &#39;stream&#39; using the specified &#39;version&#39; format, and return a
           // reference to &#39;stream&#39;.  If &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid, this
           // operation has no effect.  If &#39;version&#39; is not supported, this
           // object is unaltered and &#39;stream&#39; is invalidated, but otherwise
           // unmodified.  If &#39;version&#39; is supported but &#39;stream&#39; becomes
           // invalid during this operation, this object has an undefined, but
           // valid, state.  Note that no version is read from &#39;stream&#39;.  See
           // the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more information on
           // BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

       // ACCESSORS
       int x() const { return d_x; }
       int y() const { return d_y; }

       template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
       STREAM&amp; bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp; stream, int version) const;
           // Write the value of this object, using the specified &#39;version&#39;
           // format, to the specified output &#39;stream&#39;, and return a reference
           // to &#39;stream&#39;.  If &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid, this operation
           // has no effect.  If &#39;version&#39; is not supported, &#39;stream&#39; is
           // invalidated, but otherwise unmodified.  Note that &#39;version&#39; is
           // not written to &#39;stream&#39;.  See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level
           // documentation for more information on BDEX streaming of
           // value-semantic types and containers.
   };
..
 The implementations of the new BDEX-required methods might be as follows.  The
 &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39; method simply returns the value 1 regardless of the
 &#39;versionSelector&#39; requested:
..
  inline
  int MyPoint::maxSupportedBdexVersion(int versionSelector)
  {
      return 1;
  }
..
 The &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39; method is an accessor (i.e., a &#39;const&#39; instance method),
 and is therefore a bit simpler, so we&#39;ll show that one first.  Anyway, it&#39;s a
 bit more logical to see the output format before implementing the input
 format.  The method is a template method parameterized by &#39;STREAM&#39;, and the
 &quot;protocol&quot; of that &#39;STREAM&#39; must be compatible with the BDEX contract.  We can
 therefore safely assume that the &#39;stream&#39; object has the required methods.
 See the &quot;The BDEX Protocols&quot; section above for the contracts.  The heart of
 the method is the two sequential calls to &#39;putInt32&#39;, which externalize the
 &#39;x&#39; and &#39;y&#39; coordinates of the point value, in that order.  These two lines
 are all the &quot;new&quot; code that the developer must understand and implement.
 Except for changing the class name from our &#39;MyPoint&#39; example, the rest of the
 code can be copied into the new component implementation directly.  Note that
 this template method is implemented in the header of the component defining
 &#39;MyClass&#39;:
..
  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; MyPoint::bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp; stream, int version) const
  {
      switch (version) {
        case 1: { // Implementation-specific code goes here.
          stream.putInt32(d_x);
          stream.putInt32(d_y);
        } break;
        default: {
          stream.invalidate();
        } break;
      }
      return stream;
  }
..
 Having implemented &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39;, implementing &#39;bdexStreamIn&#39; is extremely
 straightforward, involving a template member function whose body can be safely
 copied from this example or from any appropriate component.  Note that the two
 sequential calls to &#39;getInt32&#39; must match, in both method selection and data
 member order, the &#39;putInt32&#39; methods used in the &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39; method:
..
  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; MyPoint::bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, int version)
  {
      if (stream) {
          switch (version) {
              // switch on the schema version (starting with 1)
            case 1: { // Implementation-specific code goes here.
              stream.getInt32(d_x);
              stream.getInt32(d_y);
            } break;
            default: {
              stream.invalidate();
            } break;
          }
      }
      return stream;
  }
..
 The above implementation is sufficient for our point class, and with a very
 few additional considerations, illustrates the general recipe for
 incorporating BDEX streaming into a class that has an externalizable value.

 Very briefly, we will mention two considerations that may be important when
 implementing a type that is more complicated than our simple point class.

 For our first consideration, notice that, for our simple point class, any
 pattern of bits within the two &#39;int&#39; data members represents a valid value.
 However, in general, since we require the state of an object to be valid in
 the face of a stream error (e.g., an exception being thrown during streaming
 in), the manipulator method &#39;bdexStreamIn&#39; must validate the input data, set
 the object to some valid state in the case of an error, and invalidate the
 stream before returning.

 The second consideration is that if the new type being implemented has as a
 data member a type that is already BDEX-compliant, the new implementation
 would use that data member&#39;s BDEX methods rather than the stream&#39;s methods
 directly.  This is important for encapsulation.

/Recommended Selection of &#39;versionSelector&#39;
/------------------------------------------
 BDEX provides two concepts that support versioning the BDEX serialization
 format of a type: &#39;version&#39; and &#39;versionSelector&#39;.  A &#39;version&#39; is a 1-based
 integer indicating one of the supported formats (e.g., format 1, format 2,
 etc.).  A &#39;versionSelector&#39; is a value that is mapped to a &#39;version&#39; for a
 type by the type&#39;s implementation of &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39;.

 Selecting a value for a &#39;versionSelector&#39; is required at two different points:
 (1) when implementing a new &#39;version&#39; format within the &#39;bdexStreamIn&#39; and
 &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39; methods of a type, and (2) when implementing code that
 constructs a BDEX &#39;OutStream&#39;.  In both cases, the value should be a
 *compile*-time-selected value.

 When a new &#39;version&#39; format is implemented within the &#39;bdexStreamIn&#39; and
 &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39; methods of a type, a new mapping in &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39;
 should be created to expose this new &#39;version&#39; with a &#39;versionSelector&#39;.  A
 simple - and the recommended - approach is to use a value having the pattern
 &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot;, where &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot; corresponds to the &quot;go-live&quot; date of the
 corresponding &#39;version&#39; format.

 When constructing an &#39;OutStream&#39;, a simple approach is to use the current date
 as a *compile*-time constant value (but see {Updating Production Systems}).
 In combination with the recommended selection of &#39;versionSelector&#39; values for
 &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39;, this will result in consistent and predictable
 behavior while externalizing types.  Note that this recommendation is chosen
 for its simplicity: to ensure the largest possible audience for an
 externalized representation, clients can select the minimum date value that
 will result in the desired version of all types externalized with &#39;operator&lt;&lt;&#39;
 being selected.

 Clients streaming one or more objects with BDEX create a stream and supply a
 &#39;versionSelector&#39;:
..
  MyObject foo( /* some value */ );
  bslx::ByteOutStream stream(20140725);   // The minimum date that will
                                          // result in all streamed types
                                          // using the correct versions
                                          // during externalization.
  stream &lt;&lt; foo;
..
 Notice that the &#39;versionSelector&#39; is a *compile*-time-selected value (in this
 case, the minimum date that will result in all streamed types using the
 correct versions during externalization) that can be mapped to the
 serialization format version of the types being serialized.  The receiver of
 this information must support all these versions as well.  Specifying future
 dates or allowing a run-time selection of &#39;versionSelector&#39; is error prone:
 tasks exchanging serialized data are often compiled and deployed at different
 times, which would result in serialization errors if they were selecting a
 serialization version at run-time (there is no guarantee the receiver has been
 rebuilt to accept the updated format version).

 For an example, assume the &#39;MyPoint&#39; class is determined to need 64-bit
 storage for the coordinate values.  The new &#39;bdexStreamIn&#39; and &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39;
 code might be implemented as:
..
  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; MyPoint::bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, int version)
  {
      if (stream) {
          switch (version) {
              // switch on the schema version (starting with 1)
            case 2: { // Implementation-specific code goes here.
              stream.getInt64(d_x);
              stream.getInt64(d_y);
            } break;
            case 1: { // NOTE: &#39;d_x&#39; and &#39;d_y&#39; were switched to 64-bit
              int tmp;
              stream.getInt32(tmp);
              d_x = static_cast&lt;bsls::Types::Int64&gt;(tmp);
              stream.getInt32(tmp);
              d_y = static_cast&lt;bsls::Types::Int64&gt;(tmp);
            } break;
            default: {
              stream.invalidate();
            } break;
          }
      }
      return stream;
  }

  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; MyPoint::bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp; stream, int version) const
  {
      switch (version) {
        case 2: {
          stream.putInt64(d_x);
          stream.putInt64(d_y);
        } break;
        case 1: { // NOTE: &#39;d_x&#39; and &#39;d_y&#39; were switched to 64-bit
          stream.putInt32(static_cast&lt;int&gt;(d_x));
          stream.putInt32(static_cast&lt;int&gt;(d_y));
        } break;
        default: {
          stream.invalidate();
        } break;
      }
      return stream;
  }
..
 The corresponding &#39;maxSupportedBdexVersion&#39;, where 2014/04/02 is the date on
 which the new version is introduced, might look something like:
..
  inline
  int MyPoint::maxSupportedBdexVersion(int versionSelector)
  {
      if (versionSelector &gt;= 20140402) {
          return 2;                                                   // RETURN
      }
      return 1;
  }
..

/Updating Production Systems
----------------------------
 The basic recommendation for choosing a &#39;versionSelector&#39; (which is supplied
 to the BDEX &#39;OutStream&#39; constructor) is to use the current date as a
 *compile*-time constant value.  Using the current date will select the most
 recent BDEX version.  However, in environments were multiple tasks may be
 reading the resulting serialized value, it is important to ensure that all the
 tasks participating in the system are capable of reading that BDEX version
 before selecting it as an output version.

 The roll-out of a new BDEX version for an existing type (&#39;A&#39;) in a production
 system typically involves these steps:

: 1 Update Type &#39;A&#39;, introducing a new BDEX version, and version selector for
:   that version that is the date the change is expected to &quot;go-live&quot;.
:
: 2 Rebuild and redeploy all the tasks that de-serialize &#39;A&#39;.
:
: 3 Update the version selector for tasks that serialize &#39;A&#39; (choosing the date
:   used in step 1).
:
: 4 Rebuild and redeploy all the tasks that serialize &#39;A&#39;.

/Overloading BDEX Free Functions
/-------------------------------
 For third-party components, and potentially enumerations, three free functions
 are available for overloading to allow BDEX streaming of these types.
 Overloading these methods takes priority over any class methods defined for
 similar functionality.  Note that either none or all three must be overloaded
 to ensure proper behavior.

 Within the component&#39;s namespace, the following methods may be overloaded:
..
  template &lt;class STREAM, class TYPE&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, TYPE&amp; variable, int version);
      // Assign to the specified &#39;variable&#39; the &#39;TYPE&#39; value read from the
      // specified input &#39;stream&#39; using the specified &#39;version&#39; format, and
      // return a reference to &#39;stream&#39;.  If &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid,
      // this operation has no effect.  If &#39;version&#39; is not supported by
      // &#39;TYPE&#39;, &#39;variable&#39; is unaltered and &#39;stream&#39; is invalidated, but
      // otherwise unmodified.  If &#39;version&#39; is supported by &#39;TYPE&#39; but
      // &#39;stream&#39; becomes invalid during this operation, &#39;variable&#39; has an
      // undefined, but valid, state.  The behavior is undefined unless
      // &#39;STREAM&#39; and &#39;TYPE&#39; are BDEX-compliant.  Note that no version is read
      // from &#39;stream&#39;.  See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more
      // information on BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

  template &lt;class STREAM, class TYPE&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp; stream, const TYPE&amp; value, int version);
      // Write the specified &#39;value&#39;, using the specified &#39;version&#39; format, to
      // the specified output &#39;stream&#39;, and return a reference to &#39;stream&#39;.  If
      // &#39;stream&#39; is initially invalid, this operation has no effect.  If
      // &#39;version&#39; is not supported by &#39;TYPE&#39;, &#39;stream&#39; is invalidated, but
      // otherwise unmodified.  The behavior is undefined unless &#39;STREAM&#39; and
      // &#39;TYPE&#39; are BDEX-compliant.  Note that &#39;version&#39; is not written to
      // &#39;stream&#39;.  See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more
      // information on BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

  template &lt;class TYPE&gt;
  int maxSupportedBdexVersion(const TYPE *, int versionSelector);
      // Return the maximum valid BDEX format version, as indicated by the
      // specified &#39;versionSelector&#39;, to be passed to the &#39;bdexStreamOut&#39;
      // method while streaming an object of the (template parameter) type
      // &#39;TYPE&#39;.  Note that it is highly recommended that &#39;versionSelector&#39; be
      // formatted as &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot;, a date representation.  Also note that
      // &#39;versionSelector&#39; should be a *compile*-time-chosen value that selects
      // a format version supported by both externalizer and unexternalizer.
      // See the &#39;bslx&#39; package-level documentation for more information on
      // BDEX streaming of value-semantic types and containers.
..
 As a brief example, consider the following enumeration that is to be streamed
 as an 8-bit integer as opposed to the default 32-bit integer:
..
  namespace ThirdParty {

  struct MyStruct {
    public:
      enum Value {
          e_A = 7,
          e_B = 8,
          e_C = 9
      };
  };

  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamIn(STREAM&amp; stream, MyStruct::Value&amp; value, int version)
  {
      using bslx::InStreamFunctions::bdexStreamIn;

      if (stream) {
          switch (version) {
            case 1: {
              char newValue;
              stream.getInt8(newValue);
              if (stream) {
                  value = static_cast&lt;MyStruct::Value&gt;(newValue);
              }
            } break;
            default: {
              stream.invalidate();
            } break;
          }
      }
      return stream;
  }

  template &lt;class STREAM&gt;
  STREAM&amp; bdexStreamOut(STREAM&amp;                stream,
                        const MyStruct::Value&amp; value,
                        int                    version)
  {
      using bslx::OutStreamFunctions::bdexStreamOut;

      if (stream) {
          switch (version) {
            case 1: {
              stream.putInt8(static_cast&lt;char&gt;(value));
            } break;
            default: {
              stream.invalidate();
            } break;
          }
      }
      return stream;
  }

  inline
  int maxSupportedBdexVersion(const MyStruct::Value *,
                              int                    versionSelector)
  {
      using bslx::VersionFunctions::maxSupportedBdexVersion;

      return 1;
  }

  }  // close ThirdParty namespace

/Backward Compatibility with Older BDEX Serialization Packages
