@PURPOSE: Define externalization protocols and provide implementations.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Environment eXternalization (bdex)

@AUTHOR Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@SEE_ALSO:

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdex' package defines (via documentation) a protocol for
 externalization (i.e., for an "out stream") and a protocol for
 "unexternalization" (i.e., for an "in stream"), and provides several concrete
 implementations of each kind of stream, including streams for testing.  In
 general, concrete streams must be used in matched pairs, as described in more
 detail below.

 'bdex' also provides an input stream protocol class and an output stream
 protocol class, and a pair of parameterized concrete streams that implement
 the respective interfaces, which provide support for 'bdex' streaming of
 polymorphic types.

..
 Components providing concrete streams define classes whose names are the
 appropriate mixed-case spellings of the component names.  For example,
 'bdex_byteinstream' provides the 'bdex_ByteInStream' object, a concrete input
 stream.

/Externalization
/---------------
 Externalization is the process of creating another representation for an
 in-memory object (also referred to as an "in-core" object) that can be, but
 need not be, stored external to processor memory.  Often this is done by
 streaming the object as a sequence (or array) of bytes, sometimes called
 "flattening" the object, because of the one-dimensional structure of a
 sequence or array.  Such flattening allows easy externalization of the object,
 since a byte sequence can be written to a disk file without further
 modification.  It is similarly the native *format* for other externalization
 *mechanisms*, such as OS sockets, and in conjunction with these can be used to
 stream the object outside of processor memory.  Other externalizations include
 storing the relevant data members among various tables and fields of a
 relational database.

 The 'bdex' streams provide better support for externalization than 'iostream'
 objects, because 'bdex' specifies a canonical, optimized representation for
 fundamental types and provides component authors the tools to externalize any
 in-core object.  The protocol standards are platform-neutral, and all
 implementations in this package are compliant: they have been tested on 32-bit
 and 64-bit Sun UltraSPARCs; on Wintel machines; on Data General AViiON Pentium
 Pros; and on 32-bit and 64-bit IBM computers.

/Supported Types
/---------------
 The supported types and required content are listed in the table below.
 All of the fundamental types in the table may be streamed as scalar values or
 as homogeneous arrays.  'std::string' is streamed as a logical scalar string.
 Note that 'Int64' and 'Uint64' denote 'bdes_PlatformUtil::Int64' and
 'bdes_PlatformUtil::Uint64', respectively, which in turn are 'typedef' names
 for the signed and unsigned 64-bit integer types, respectively, on the host
 platform.
..
  C++ TYPE          REQUIRED CONTENT OF ANY PLATFORM NEUTRAL FORMAT
  --------------    -----------------------------------------------
  Int64             least significant 64 bits (signed)
  Uint64            least significant 64 bits (unsigned)
  int               least significant 32 bits (signed)
  unsigned int      least significant 32 bits (unsigned)
  short             least significant 16 bits (signed)
  unsigned short    least significant 16 bits (unsigned)
  char              least significant  8 bits (platform dependent)
  signed char       least significant  8 bits (signed)
  unsigned char     least significant  8 bits (unsigned)
  double            IEEE standard 8-byte floating-point value
  float             IEEE standard 4-byte floating-point value

  std::string       BDE implementation of the STL string class
..
 'bdex' also supports compact streaming of integer types.  In particular,
 64-bit integers can be streamed as 40-, 48-, 56-, or 64-bit values, and 32-bit
 integers can be streamed as 24- or 32-bit values, at the user's discretion.
 In all cases, the least significant bytes of the fundamental integer type are
 written to the stream.  Therefore, outputting a signed value may not preserve
 the sign of the original value; it is the user's responsibility to choose
 output methods appropriate to the data.  On input, however, the non-standard
 bit patterns are sign-extended, so that correctly-written values will always
 be correctly read.

@The 'bdex' Protocols
 The 'bdex' protocol is primarily a "documentation-only" protocol whereby
 'bdex'-compliant value-semantic types and streams each adhere to a published
 documentation standard (this document) in order to interoperate correctly.
 The protocol specifies what components that wish to support 'bdex' streaming
 must provide (three specifically-named methods), and what services the
 component can expect from all compliant streams (various "put" and "get"
 methods).  In addition, 'bdex' also supplies two abstract interfaces,
 'bdex_InStream' and 'bdex_OutStream', that serve both as base classes and as
 the "documentation protocols" for input and output streams, respectively.

/Requirements for a 'bdex'-Compliant Class to be Streamable
/----------------------------------------------------------
 In this section we give a brief synopsis of the required member functions for
 a class in order to be 'bdex'-streamable.  See the "Using 'bdex' with Your Own
 Class" section below for implementation details.

 The required signatures and typical documentation (some behavioral details may
 be implementation-specific) of the three required methods for a
 'bdex'-compliant class are as follows.
..
    // CLASS METHODS
    static int maxSupportedBdexVersion();
        // Return the most current 'bdex' streaming version number supported by
        // this class.  See the 'bdex' package-level documentation for more
        // information on 'bdex' streaming of value-semantic types and
        // containers.

    // MANIPULATORS
    template <class STREAM>
    STREAM& bdexStreamIn(STREAM& stream, int version);
        // Assign to this object the value read from the specified input
        // 'stream' using the specified 'version' format and return a reference
        // to the modifiable 'stream'.  If 'stream' is initially invalid, this
        // operation has no effect.  If 'stream' becomes invalid during this
        // operation or if 'version' is not supported, this object is
        // unaltered.  Note that no version is read from 'stream'.  See the
        // 'bdex' package-level documentation for more information on 'bdex'
        // streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

    // ACCESSORS
    template <class STREAM>
    STREAM& bdexStreamOut(STREAM& stream, int version) const;
        // Write this value to the specified output 'stream' using the
        // specified 'version' format and return a reference to the
        // modifiable 'stream'.  If 'version' is not supported, 'stream' is
        // unmodified.  Note that 'version' is not written to 'stream'.
        // See the 'bdex' package-level documentation for more information
        // on 'bdex' streaming of value-semantic types and containers.
..

/Requirements for a 'bdex'-Compliant Stream
/------------------------------------------

 Clients can rely on 'bdex'-compliant output and input streams to provide a
 full set of "put" and "get" methods, respectively.  These methods are
 described in detail in Appendix I and Appendix II, respectively.  Each 'bdex'
 compliant stream must also provide the appropriate templatized 'operator<<' or
 'operator>>', implemented to cooperate with 'bdex' compliant value-semantic
 components.  These operators are also described in the Appendices below.

/Template Magic Makes it All Work
/--------------------------------

/Streaming Polymorphic Types
/---------------------------

@Two Aspects of 'bdex' "Usage"
 Broadly speaking, there are two distinct aspects to "using" 'bdex'.  One is
 using the 'bdex' facilities already incorporated into BDE components, and the
 other is incorporating 'bdex' into new components (whether in the BDE library
 or not).  We expect that the former will be the more common mode for typical
 users, but we will document both modes.

 In truth, there is a third mode of 'bdex' usage: writing a new concrete
 stream.  This task will most likely be done by the BDE team itself -- and
 clients are encouraged to ask for specific stream needs.  Future documentation
 will address this more advanced aspect of 'bdex' usage.  Clients are free to
 write special-purpose 'bdex'-compliant streams at need.  See the stream
 protocols in Appendix I and Appendix II below.

/Using 'bdex' with Existing BDE Components
/-----------------------------------------
 All BDE value semantic types (as part of the definition of being "value
 semantic") support 'bdex' externalization.  That is to say, their "values" can
 be uniquely represented as a sequence of 'bdex' primitive externalizations.
 Hence, these values can be restored in any other process -- and indeed in any
 other language -- that correctly implements the corresponding
 unexternalization functionality.  Therefore, any user of, e.g., 'bdet_Date'
 can expect to generate one or more date values in-core, externalize those
 values, and restore (i.e., unexternalize) the same values locally or remotely,
 all with minimal effort.  'bdex' externalization is especially important when
 using 'bdem' messaging; see the 'bdem' package-level documentation and
 especially the "BDEM Lesson 1" Tutorial Usage Example on {BP BDED <GO>} for
 examples of using 'bdex' with other BDE code.

 Using 'bdex' with existing BDE components is easy, and the steps can be
 summarized as follows:
..
   To externalize an existing BDE object value:
     1) Create a 'bdex' "out stream" object.
     2) Use 'operator<<' to externalize the value to the stream.

   To unexternalize (i.e., initialize) a BDE object from an out stream buffer:
     1) Use the buffer to create an "in stream" object.
     2) Use 'operator>>' to stream the value into the BDE object.
..
 We'll go through the details, but that's about all that there is to do.
 First, we'll just say a bit more about choosing a stream from among the
 existing 'bdex' streams.

/Selection of Streams
/- - - - - - - - - -
 Several kinds of 'bdex'-compliant streams already exist, and many more are
 possible.  At present, there are three pairs of concrete streams in 'bdex':
..
   Out Stream               In Stream              Informal Designation
   ---------------------    ------------------     --------------------
   bdex_ByteOutStream       bdex_ByteInStream      "Production Streams"
   bdex_ByteOutStreamRaw    bdex_ByteInStreamRaw   "Raw Streams"
   bdex_TestOutStream       bdex_TestInStream      "Test Streams"
..
 The informal designations are used throughout this document, and are commonly
 used in spoken language by the BDE team.

 In general, the concrete "inStreams" and "outStreams" must be used in matched
 pairs.  For example, the user should not expect correct behavior if an object
 is externalized to a 'bdex_TestOutStream' and then unexternalized from a
 seemingly-appropriately-constructed 'bdex_ByteInStream'.  Each pair of streams
 is designed with different aims in mind, and so their exact formats may vary.

 The production and raw streams are, however, intended to interoperate; they
 all use the same format.  The raw streams have in common that they do not
 manage or own the buffers that they use, but rather just copy pointers to
 user-supplied buffers on construction.  The ramifications of this design
 choice are rather different for input and output streams (see the specific
 Usage Warning sections in the 'bdex_byteoutstreamraw' and
 'bdex_byteoutstreamraw' component documentation -- the raw out-stream is
 *very* dangerous, while the raw in-stream is only mildly so).  Therefore the
 user may wish to "mix and match" streams, depending upon that user's specific
 needs and risk tolerances.  Consult the component documentation carefully
 before choosing a raw stream.

 The typical user will probably be content to use the production streams for
 most purposes.  We will assume that the production stream is the "correct"
 choice without further explicit discussion in most usage examples.  See the
 individual stream component documentation for specific details about using
 other streams.

/Using 'bdex' to Externalize a 'bdet_Date' Value
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The following snippet of code, as simple as it appears, is really all that one
 needs to use 'bdex' under many practical circumstances.  First, create a
 'bdet_Date' value 'birthday' (see the 'bdet_date' component documentation for
 details).
..
     bdet_Date birthday(2004, 4, 30);
..
 Next, create a 'bdex_ByteOutStream' object 'outStream'.  The default
 constructor is adequate much of the time.
..
     bdex_ByteOutStream outStream;
..
 Then, stream 'birthday' to 'outStream' using the overloaded 'operator<<'
 defined in 'bdex_ByteOutStream'.
..
     outStream << birthday;
..
 That's it.  The value of 'birthday' is now in the stream.  To send this value
 anywhere at all that understands the 'bdex_ByteOutStream' format, simply
 extract the data buffer from 'outStream' (as a 'char*') and send that buffer
 (along with its length) to wherever it needs to go via your favorite transport
 mechanism (see, e.g., the 'bte' package group documentation for various
 transport mechanisms).  The 'data' and 'length' methods make this extraction
 straightforward.
..
     const char *buffer;
     int         bufferLength;

     buffer       = outStream.data();
     bufferLength = outStream.length();

     // Transport 'buffer' and 'bufferLength' as desired.
..
 If we assume that 'buffer' and 'bufferLength' have been transported into the
 scope implicitly used below, then the following code will initialize a
 'bdet_Date' object with the value of 'birthday' above.  First, create a
 default 'bdet_Date' object 'yourBirthday' and use 'buffer' and 'bufferLength'
 to initialize a 'bdex_ByteInStream' object 'inStream'.
..
     const char *buffer;        // Assumed initialized by transport code
     int         bufferLength;  // Assumed initialized by transport code

     bdet_Date   yourBirthday;  // This will be initialized by 'bdex'.

     bdex_ByteInStream inStream(buffer, bufferLength);
..
 Now use 'operator>>' and 'inStream' to set the value of 'yourBirthday'.
..
     inStream >> yourBirthday;
..
 We're done; 'yourBirthday' is ready to use.

/Using 'bdex' with Your Own Class
/--------------------------------
 We will show a very brief example of a fictitious 'm_myapp_MyPoint' class
 whose intended purpose is to hold a pair of 'int' values representing a point
 in a two-dimensional rectilinear coordinate space.  We will first define the
 class without 'bdex' support and then add that support.  Note that, in this
 example, most of the required documentation and some required methods and free
 operators are omitted for ease of viewing.  See, e.g., the 'bdet_date'
 component for a real example of how to implement 'bdex' functionality in a
 proper value-semantic object.

 A simple implementation of 'm_myapp_MyPoint' might be:
..
 class m_myapp_MyPoint {
     int d_x;
     int d_y;

   public:
     // CREATORS
     m_myapp_MyPoint() : d_x(0), d_y(0) { }
     m_myapp_MyPoint(int x, int y) : d_x(y), d_y(y) { }
     m_myapp_MyPoint(const m_myapp_MyPoint& original)
       : d_x(original.d_x), d_y(original.d_y) { }
     ~m_myapp_MyPoint() { }

     // MANIPULATORS
     m_myapp_MyPoint& operator=(const m_myapp_MyPoint& rhs)
         { d_x = rhs.d_x;  d_y = rhs.d_y; }
     void setX(int x) { d_x = x; }
     void setY(int y) { d_y = y; }

     // ACCESSORS
     int x() const { return d_x; }
     int y() const { return d_y; }
 };
..
 Putting other design decisions to one side for this discussion, we may ask:
 How would we incorporate 'bdex' streaming into such a class?  We observe that
 the actual data footprint of such a point class is two 'int' values.  If
 'bdex' succeeds in externalizing these two 'int' values (and preserving their
 order), then the task is accomplished.

 'bdex' expects a compliant class to provide three methods, a class method, a
 manipulator, and an accessor, with the following names, signatures, and
 contracts:
..
    // CLASS METHODS
     static int maxSupportedBdexVersion();
        // Return the most current 'bdex' streaming version number supported by
        // this class.

    // MANIPULATORS
    template <class STREAM>
    STREAM& bdexStreamIn(STREAM& stream, int version);
        // Assign to this object the value read from the specified input
        // 'stream' using the specified 'version' format and return a reference
        // to the modifiable 'stream'.  If 'stream' is initially invalid, this
        // operation has no effect.  If 'stream' becomes invalid during this
        // operation or if 'version' is not supported, this object is
        // unaltered.  Note that no version is read from 'stream'.  See the
        // 'bdex' package-level documentation for more information on 'bdex'
        // streaming of value-semantic types and containers.

    // ACCESSORS
    template <class STREAM>
    STREAM& bdexStreamOut(STREAM& stream, int version) const;
        // Write this value to the specified output 'stream' using the
        // specified 'version' format and return a reference to the
        // modifiable 'stream'.  If 'version' is not supported, 'stream' is
        // unmodified.  Note that 'version' is not written to 'stream'.
        // See the 'bdex' package-level documentation for more information
        // on 'bdex' streaming of value-semantic types and containers.
..
 The above function-level documentation should make the purpose of each method
 clear, and we will show the implementations for 'm_myapp_MyPoint' soon, but
 first let's just say a few words about "version".  In a nutshell, the version
 is set to 1 in the initial release of the component, and in the best of all
 worlds, the version stays 1 forever.  If, however, for some reason the
 developer wishes to alter the 'bdex' streaming contract (e.g., for some
 performance reasons), the explicit version maintains backward compatibility.

 Adding the above methods to the 'm_myapp_MyPoint' is straightforward:
..
 class m_myapp_MyPoint {
     int d_x;
     int d_y;

   public:
     // CLASS METHODS
     static int maxSupportedBdexVersion();
        // Return the most current 'bdex' streaming version number supported by
        // this class.

     // CREATORS
     m_myapp_MyPoint() : d_x(0), d_y(0) { }
     m_myapp_MyPoint(int x, int y) : d_x(y), d_y(y) { }
     m_myapp_MyPoint(const m_myapp_MyPoint& original)
       : d_x(original.d_x), d_y(original.d_y) { }
     ~m_myapp_MyPoint() { }

     // MANIPULATORS
     m_myapp_MyPoint& operator=(const m_myapp_MyPoint& rhs)
         { d_x = rhs.d_x;  d_y = rhs.d_y; }
     void setX(int x) { d_x = x; }
     void setY(int y) { d_y = y; }

     template <class STREAM>
     STREAM& bdexStreamIn(STREAM& stream, int version);
        // Assign to this object the value read from the specified input
        // 'stream' using the specified 'version' format and return a reference
        // to the modifiable 'stream'.  If 'stream' is initially invalid, this
        // operation has no effect.  If 'stream' becomes invalid during this
        // operation, this object is valid, but its value is undefined.  If the
        // specified 'version' is not supported, 'stream' is marked invalid,
        // but this object is unaltered.  Note that no version is read from
        // 'stream'.

     // ACCESSORS
     int x() const { return d_x; }
     int y() const { return d_y; }

     template <class STREAM>
     STREAM& bdexStreamOut(STREAM& stream, int version) const;
        // Write this value to the specified output 'stream' and return a
        // reference to the modifiable 'stream'.  Optionally specify an
        // explicit 'version' format; by default, the maximum supported version
        // is written to 'stream' and used as the format.  If 'version' is
        // specified, that format is used but *not* written to 'stream'.  If
        // 'version' is not supported, 'stream' is left unmodified.
 };
..
 The implementations of the new 'bdex'-required methods might be as follows.
 The 'maxSupportedBdexVersion' method simply returns the value 1.
..
    inline
    int m_myapp_MyPoint::maxSupportedBdexVersion()
    {
        return 1;
    }
..
 The 'bdexStreamOut' method is an accessor (i.e., a 'const' instance method),
 and is therefore a bit simpler, so we'll show that one first.  Anyway, it's a
 bit more logical to see the output format before implementing the input
 format.  The method is a template method parameterized by 'STREAM', and the
 "protocol" is that 'STREAM' must be compatible with the 'bdex' contract.  We
 can therefore safely assume that the 'stream' object has the required methods.
 See the "The bdex Protocols" section above for the contracts.  The heart of
 the method is the two sequential calls to 'putInt32', which externalize the x
 and y coordinates of the point value, in that order.  These two lines are all
 the "new" code that the developer must understand and implement.  Except for
 changing the class name from our 'm_myapp_MyPoint' example, the rest of the
 code can be copied into the new component implementation directly.  Note that
 this template method is declared 'inline' and implemented in the header of the
 component defining 'm_myapp_MyClass'.
..
    template <class STREAM>
    inline
    STREAM& m_myapp_MyPoint::bdexStreamOut(STREAM& stream, int version) const
    {
        switch (version) {
          case 1: { // Implementation-specific code goes here
            stream.putInt32(d_x);
            stream.putInt32(d_y);
          } break;
        }
        return stream;
    }
..
 Having implemented 'bdexStreamOut', implementing 'bdexStreamIn' is extremely
 straightforward, involving an 'inline' template member function whose body can
 be safely copied from this example or from any appropriate BDE component.
 Note that the two sequential calls to 'getInt32' must match, in both method
 selection and data member order, the 'put' methods used in the 'bdexStreamOut'
 method.
..
    template <class STREAM>
    inline
    STREAM& m_myapp_MyPoint::bdexStreamIn(STREAM& stream, int version)
    {
        if (stream) {
            switch (version) {// switch on the schema version (starting with 1)
              case 1: { // Implementation-specific code goes here
                  stream.getInt32(d_x);
                  stream.getInt32(d_y);
              if (!stream) {
                  return stream;
              }
          } break;
          default: {
            stream.invalidate();
          }
        }
    }
    return stream;
}
..
 The above implementation is sufficient for our point class, and with a very
 few additional considerations, illustrates the general recipe for
 incorporating 'bdex' streaming into a class that has an externalizable value.

 Very briefly, we will mention two considerations that may be important when
 implementing a type that is more complicated than our simple point class.  An
 excellent real-world tutorial can be found by reviewing the various 'bdex'
 implementations of more complicated BDE value-semantic types.

 For our first consideration, notice that, for our simple point class, any
 pattern of bits within the two 'int' data members represents a valid value.
 Since our BDE contract requires the state of an object to be valid in the face
 of a stream error (e.g., and exception being thrown during streaming in), the
 manipulator method 'bdexStreamIn' must validate the input data, set the
 object to some valid state in the case of an error, and invalidate the stream
 before returning.  See the 'bdet_date' implementation, for which not all bit
 patterns are valid, for an example of this case.

 The second consideration is that if the new type being implemented has as a
 data member a type that is already 'bdex' compliant, the new implementation
 would use the data member's 'bdex' methods rather than the stream's methods
 directly.  This is important for encapsulation.  See, e.g., 'bdem_list' for an
 example of "sub-contracting" existing 'bdex' functionality in the
 implementation of the container object's 'bdex' functionality.
