 The 'btlmt' package currently has 10 components having 4 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

/Framework Overview
/------------------
 The 'btlmt' package can be viewed as a framework for building efficient
 multi-threaded applications requiring interprocess communication (IPC).
 'btlmt' provides the structure whereby multiple threads within a process can
 engage in IPC via a flexible message format.  In general functionality,
 'btlmt' is similar to the 'ptdispatch' framework, except that 'btlmt' uses
 TCP/IP sockets and not 'fstsnd' as its transport mechanism.  The following
 overview presents the main 'btlmt' components and types, plus other types used
 by the framework.

/Channel Queue Pool
/- - - - - - - - -
 The heart of the 'btlmt' framework, sitting at the top of the component
 physical hierarchy, is 'btlmt_channelqueuepool', which provides the
 'btlmt_ChannelQueuePool' object (CQP).  The CQP provides queue-based message
 transport over IPv4-addressed byte-stream communication channels.  (See the
 {'btlsc'} package documentation for an overview of the 'btl' stream-based
 channel protocols, and see the {'btlso'} package documentation for details
 about concrete TCP/IPv4 channels.)  The CQP creates channels automatically as
 needed when the appropriate events occur, and destroys those channels based on
 user requests.  For example, a new channel is allocated automatically when an
 incoming connection is accepted, or when a user explicitly requests a
 connection to a server.  The CQP creates both client (connector) and server
 (acceptor) channels as appropriate.

/Message
/- - - -
 There are four physical-hierarchy peer components at the bottom (Level 1) of
 the hierarchy, but we will focus on 'btlmt_message' as being the most central
 of these to understand, if only because the user will most likely be
 interacting with messages most directly and frequently in the course of
 writing useful code.  'btlmt_message' provides several distinct message
 objects and one generic message container.  The distinct message objects are:
..
    Class               Message Contents
    ---------------     ----------------
    btlmt_DataMsg       raw data as read from a socket
    btlmt_ChannelMsg    a new state for a channel
    btlmt_PoolMsg       an event from the pool
    btlmt_TimerMsg      notification that a timer is expired
    btlmt_UserMsg       user-generated message
    btlmt_Message       container for a generic message
..
 Details regarding messages can be found in both the 'btlmt_message' and
 'btlmt_channelqueuepool' component documentation.  One point worth mentioning
 here is that the CPQ messages are protocol-neutral, meaning that CPQ supports
 message delivery using any application-level (i.e., OSI levels 5-7) protocol.
 This in turn means that the data in any one Data message may contain a
 non-integral number of (logical) messages.  The CQP therefore provides a
 'ParseMessagesCallback' type, which should be used to distinguish message
 boundaries.  The Usage Example below illustrates this message-boundary issue.

/Channel Pool
/- - - - - -
 The 'btlmt_ChannelPool' object (CP) itself is provided by the
 'btlmt_channelpool' component.  The CP is in its own right a useful manager of
 TCP/IPv4 channels, but in the context of the most straightforward use of the
 'btlmt' framework, the CP can be regarded as an implementation detail of the
 CQP.  (See the {'btlmt_channelpool'} component documentation for information
 about the CP.)  The main mode of interaction with the CP is through the
 'btlmt_ChannelPoolConfiguration' object (CPC), which will be discussed next.
 Even so, the CPC can be regarded as setting the configuration of a logical CP
 within the CQP, so the CP itself can be largely ignored by new users of
 'btlmt'.

/Channel Pool Configuration
/- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The CPC provides a "constrained attributes" class for the CP, which is to say
 that althought the CPC is in some sense a 'struct' of parameters
 characterizing a CP, these parameters are not all independent of one another.
 The CPC manages the constraints among the attributes.  In particular, the CPC
 "set" methods for constrained values will fail if their arguments are not
 consistent with the constraints (see the two tables below).  Also, the CPC
 constructor does not take any constrained arguments, but rather sets those
 values to valid defaults unconditionally.  This behavior avoids "silent
 failures", since the constructor cannot explicitly return a status value.

 The attributes contained by a CPC and the attribute constraints are given,
 respectively, in two tables below.  The attributes are as follows:
..
  TYPE                 NAME                DESCRIPTION
  ------------------   --------------      --------------------------------
   int                 maxConnections      maximum number of connections
                                           that can be managed by a channel
                                           pool
   int                 maxThreads          maximum number of threads managed
                                           by a channel pool
   int                 maxWriteCache       maximum number of bytesto be
                                           cached in the outgoingbuffer for
                                           a managed channel

   int                 typMessageSizeOut   output message strategy hint
   int                 maxMessageSizeOut   output message strategy hint
   int                 minMessageSizeIn    input  message strategy hint
   int                 typMessageSizeIn    input  message strategy hint
   int                 maxMessageSizeIn    input  message strategy hint
   int                 workloadThreshold   threshold of the workload for an
                                           event manager after which
                                           a new thread will be created,
                                           or an alert generated if
                                           no new thread can be created.
..
 The constraints are as follows:
..
   NAME                 CONSTRAINT

  | maxConnections     | 0 <= maxConnections                         |

  +--------------------+---------------------------------------------+
  | workloadThreshold  | 0 <= workloadThreshold                      |
  +--------------------+---------------------------------------------+
..
 Note that the CPC ensures that the channel pool configuration is legal, but it
 does not insure that the configuration is wise.  The user must still analyze
 the requirements of the software being developed, and must have a basic
 understansing of thread and socket performance issues in order to choose an
 optimal configuration.

/TCP Timer Event Manager
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The 'btlmt_tcptimereventmanager' component provides the
 'btlmt_TcpTimerEventManager' object (TTEM), which is a multi-threaded
 implememtation of the 'btlso_TimerEventManager' protocol.  (See the
 {'btlso_timereventmanager'} component documentation for protocol details.)
 The TTEM is a thread-enabled multiplexor of socket events and timers.  Within
 the context of the 'btlmt' framework, it is safe to regard the TTEM as an
 implementation detail.  Information regarding TTEM performance can be found in
 the 'btlmt_tcptimereventmanager' component documentation.

/Queue
/- - -
 'btlmt' uses the 'bcec_Queue<btlmt_Message>' queue.  Two instances of this
 queue, one for the input queue and one for the output queue, are used as
 constructor arguments to the CQP.  These queues are held but not owned by the
 CQP, so the user is responsible for managing queue lifetimes.  Moreover, the
 user acceses each queue directly through the 'bcec_Queue' interface.  See the
 {'bcec_queue'} component documentation for details regarding this template
 queue.

/'btlmt_ChannelQueuePool::ParseMessagesCallback'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'ParseMessageCallback' is a 'typedef' within the CPQ class.  The type that is
 aliased is:
..
  bcef_Vfunc4<int *, int *, const char *, int>
..
 which is used, as its name implies, to parse the body of data messages.  As
 mentioned above, an instance of a data message as popped from a queue may have
 a non-integral number of logical messages.  It is the purpose of the message
 parsing callback to identify message boundaries and to communicate the number
 of bytes needed (if any) to complete the last (possibly partial) logical
 message within the buffer of the data message.  See {Usage} for an
 illustration.

/Resource Management
/- - - - - - - - - -
 The 'btlmt_pooldeallocator' component is deprecated, and will be replaced by a
 component that will perform the required functionality without the need of
 user intervention.  This aspect of resource management can thus safely be
 ignored by most users of 'btlmt'.

/Usage
/-----
 This section illustrates intended use of this package.

/Example 1: Implementing an Echo Server
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 We illustrate the basic usage of the 'btlmt' framework by considering an echo
 server.  Let's start with a brief overview.  The heart of the server is the
 'while(1)' loop, which endlessly pops a message off of the 'incoming' queue
 and processes it according to a 'switch' statement that dispatches the message
 depending on the message type.  Data messages are pushed back onto the
 'outgoing' queue ("echoed").

 Other steps common to 'btlmt' applications are configuring the channel pool
 (i.e., constructing and setting the attributes of a CPC object), constructing
 the two queues, and constructing and populating the 'ParseMessageCallback'
 function.  These four objects are then provided as constructor arguments to
 the CQP.  With the CQP constructed, one can enter the infinite loop described
 above.

 The full, uninterrupted example file appears at the end of this section.  The
 following snippets drawn from that example highlight the key features as
 described above.

 First, we define the file-'static' function 'parseMessages', which will be
 loaded into the 'ParseMessagesCallback' functor within 'main'.  As prescribed
 by the callback 'typedef', the functor will require four arguments of types as
 indicated above.

 As a side detail -- not central to this specific example -- note that the
 function loaded into the 'ParseMessagesCallback' functor could well take more
 than four arguments (up to nine, at present), if such a function were
 convenient for our purposes.  In that case, the initial four arguments would
 match the types of the four required arguments, and the values set for any
 trailing arguments of the underlying function would be supplied to the 'bcefu'
 'make' method.  See the {'bcef'} and {'bcefu'} package documentation for more
 details on binding functions with extra arguments to functors taking fewer
 arguments.  For our purposes, no additional arguments are needed, and so the
 'parseMessages' function is defined as follows.
..
  // btlmt_usage.m.cpp                                                -*-C++-*-

  using namespace BloombergLP;

  static
  inline void parseMessages(int        *numBytesConsumed,
                            int        *numBytesNeeded,
                            const char *data,
                            int         length)
      // Parse the specified message 'data' of the specified 'length'.  Load
      // into the specified 'numBytesConsumed' the number of bytes of 'data'
      // that comprise the number of *complete* (logical) messages within
      // 'data' and load into the specified 'numBytesNeeded' the number of
      // bytes needed to complete a trailing partial logical message within
      // 'data' or load 0 if the last logical message in 'data' was complete.
..
 Basically, the CQP will use this callback function to identify an integral
 number of complete messages.  Since the CQP is "protocol neutral", the
 lower-level transport channel has no way of knowing what the significance of
 any given number of received bytes might be.  This user-supplied function
 allows the CQP to identify message boundaries.

 In this example, the message header consists of a network-byte-order 'int'
 value denoting the total number of bytes (including the header) that comprise
 the message.  The following function body fulfills the documented contract for
 the example case of a single 'int' header.
..
  {
      int originalLength    = length;
      int processedMessages = 0;

      while(length > sizeof(int)) {
          int msgLength = ntohl(*(int*)data);  // decode message length
..
 Note here that, as a guard against malicious users, the 'msgLength' should be
 limited in the protocol.
..
          if (length < msgLength) {
             *numBytesConsumed = originalLength - length;
             *numBytesNeeded   = msgLength - length;
             return;
          }
          length -= msgLength;
          data   += msgLength;
          ++processedMessages;  // count not used in this implementation
     }

     *numBytesConsumed = originalLength - length;
     *numBytesNeeded   = sizeof(int) - length;
  }
..
 We are now ready to write 'main' as outlined above.  In this simple example,
 we hard-code several needed parameters in an 'enum.
..
  int main()
  {
      enum {
          SERVER_ID       = 0xAB,    // a cookie
          PORT_NUMBER     = 4564,
          MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10000
      };
..
 Next, we construct a default 'btlmt_ChannelPoolConfiguration' object 'config'
 and use its 'set' methods so that 'config' contains the CP configuration that
 we want.
..

      // Configure the channel
      btlmt_ChannelPoolConfiguration config;
      config.setMaxThreads(4);
      config.setMaxConnections(MAX_CONNECTIONS);
      config.setReadTimeout(5.0);                   // in seconds
      config.setWorkloadThreshold(75);              // 75% busy
      config.setMetricsInterval(10.0);              // seconds
      config.setMaxWriteCache(1<<10);               // 1Mb
      config.setIncomingMessageSizes(4, 100, 1024);
      config.setOutgoingMessageSizes(4, 100, 1024);
..
 We can write the value of 'config' to 'stdout' to confirm that we have
 correctly initialized the CPC.
..
      bsl::cout << config;
..
 Next, we instantiate a default functor 'cb' and use 'bcefu_Vfunc4::makeF' to
 load into 'cb' the 'parseMessages' function defined above.
..
      btlmt_ChannelQueuePool::ParseMessagesCallback cb;
      bcefu_Vfunc4::makeF(&cb, parseMessages);
..
 We now have our CPC and callback functor ready.  The last objects that we need
 are the 'incoming' and 'outgoing' queues.  We construct the queues, and use
 them along with the callback and the CPC to construct a CQP object 'qp'.
..
      bcec_Queue<btlmt_Message> incoming, outgoing;
      btlmt_ChannelQueuePool qp(&incoming, &outgoing, cb, config);
..

 With all of our objects and input data ready, we start the echo server by
 calling the CQP's 'start' method.  Note that we call the method from within an
 'assert' call, since we might as well abort if the CQP cannot start.
..
      assert(0 == qp.start());   // fails if no system resources.
..
 The final startup step, before entering into the body of the server loop, is
 to call the 'listen' method.  In this case, we call 'listen' within an 'if'
 statement and return an error message and call the 'stop' method before
 returning.
..
      if (0 != qp.listen(PORT_NUMBER, MAX_CONNECTIONS, SERVER_ID)) {
          bsl::cout << "Can't open server port." << bsl::endl;
          qp.stop();
          return -1;
      }
..
 The server is now live and running.  We enter an infinite 'while' loop wherein
 we call the 'popFront' method of the 'incoming' queue to fetch the next
 available message 'msg' and 'switch' on 'msg.type()'.  'msg' might be a status
 message generated by the CQP, or it might be a data message, in which case the
 datat is processed as desired and pushed back onto the 'outgoing' queue.
..
      while(1) {
          btlmt_Message msg = incoming.popFront();
          switch(msg.type()) {
            case btlmt_Message::CHANNEL_STATE: {
              const btlmt_ChannelMsg& data = msg.channelMsg();
              bsl::cout << data << bsl::endl;
            } break;
            case btlmt_Message::POOL_STATE: {
              bsl::cout << msg.poolMsg() << bsl::endl;
            } break;
            case btlmt_Message::TIMER: {
              bsl::cout << msg.timerMsg().timerId() << bsl::endl;
            } break;
            case btlmt_Message::DATA: {
              // PROCESS DATA MESSAGE HERE
              outgoing.pushBack(msg);
            } break;
         }
      }
      return 0;
  }
..
 This completes the echo server example.  The entire example file is repeated
 below without interruption for ease of reading.
