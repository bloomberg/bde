/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section summarizes the components that are available in 'bsls'.

/'bsls_alignedbuffer'
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignedbuffer'} component provides a templated buffer type with a
 user-specified compile-time size and user-specified alignment.  Typically,
 such a type is used in situations where it is desirable to allocate a block of
 properly-aligned raw memory from somewhere other than the heap, e.g., on the
 stack or within an aggregate object, including within a union.  It is a
 convenient way to create a small heap from which one or more objects are
 allocated at run-time.

/'bsls_alignment'
/ - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignment'} component computes (at compile-time) platform-dependent
 alignment information.  This component also provides a namespace for a suite
 of compile-time constants and pure procedures that yield platform-dependent
 alignment information for primitive and user-defined types, including the
 maximum alignment for any type and the smallest fundamental type requiring
 maximum alignment.  These functions, used in conjunction, are especially
 useful for creating pools and allocators that rely on efficient alignment.

/'bsls_alignmentfromtype'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignmentfromtype'} component provides a meta-function that
 provides the alignment for the parameterized 'TYPE'.

/'bsls_alignmentimp'
/- - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignmentimp'} component provides a suite of template
 meta-functions that can be used to compute (at compile-time) various
 platform-dependent alignment information.

/'bsls_alignmenttotype'
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignmenttotype'} component provides a meta-function that provides
 a primitive type with an alignment matching the parameterized 'ALLIGNMENT'.

/'bsls_alignmentutil'
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_alignmentutil'} component provides a suite of template
 meta-functions that can be used to compute (at compile-time) various
 platform-dependent alignment information.

/'bsls_annotation'
/- - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_annotation'} component provides a suite of preprocessor macros that
 define compiler-specific compile-time annotations.

/'bsls_assert'
/- - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_assert'} component provides a set of "assert-like" macros to
 implement a compile-time-selectable and run-time-configurable "defensive" or
 "safe" mode.  It also provides a suite of "assert-failure handler" methods
 suitable for runtime loading into the macros, via also provided methods.
 Users may supply their own handler methods matching the proper signature.  To
 allow the user more flexibility in changing handlers during program execution,
 this component also provides a scoped guard that allows safe, temporary
 changing of the failure handler in a limited scope.

/'bsls_asserttest'
/- - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_asserttest'} component provides a facility to test that
 'BSLS_ASSERT_*' macros are used as intended, in the appropriate build modes,
 and have the expected effects.

/'bsls_asserttestexception'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_asserttestexception'} component implements an exception class,
 'bsls::AssertTestException', that provides a mechanism to convey context
 information from a failing assertion to a test handler.

/'bsls_atomic'
/- - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_atomic'} component provides classes with atomic operations for
 'int', 'Int64', and pointer types.

/'bsls_atomicoperations'
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_atomicoperations'} component provides a set of platform-independent
 atomic operations for fundamental data types, such as 32-bit and 64-bit
 integer and pointer.

/'bsls_blockgrowth'
/ - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_blockgrowth'} component enumerates the supported block growth
 strategies.

/'bsls_bsltestutil'
/ - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_bsltestutil'} component provides the standard printing macros used
 in BDE-style test drivers.

/'bsls_buildtarget'
/ - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_buildtarget'} component defines types and runtime constants for
 identifying the build target information (usually specified to the compiler
 via a set of 'BDE_BUILD_*' macros).  This is mostly useful for retrieving such
 information from a linkable or executable binary.

/'bsls_byteorder'
/ - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_byteorder'} component provides a set host-to-network and
 network-to-host byte-order manipulation macros.

/'bsls_compilerfeatures'
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_compilerfeatures'} component provides a suite of preprocessor
 macros to identify compiler-specific support of language features that may not
 be available on all compilers in use across an organization.

/'bsls_exceptionutil'
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_exceptionutil'} component provides macros to replace 'try', 'throw'
 and 'catch'.  These macros expand to normal exception constructs when
 exceptions are enabled and to reasonable alternatives (usually no-ops) when
 exceptions are disabled, allowing code that uses 'try', 'throw' and 'catch'
 constructs to compile even if exceptions are disabled using a compiler switch.

/'bsls_ident'
/ - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_ident'} component provides macros for inserting SCM (Source Control
 Management) Ids into source files.

/'bsls_int64'
/ - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_int64'} component provides platform-independent type names for both
 signed and unsigned 64-bit integers.  For healthy platforms, the component
 simply provides a BDE-standard 'typedef' for the non-standard native type
 name.  All platforms currently supported are healthy regarding 64-bit
 integers.

/'bsls_macroincrement'
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_macroincrement'} component provides a macro,
 'BSLS_MACROINCREMENT(NUMBER)', that produces the preprocessor number equal to
 the number succeeding the supplied argument.

/'bsls_nativestd'
/ - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_nativestd'} component defines a namespace alias, 'native_std', that
 serves as an alias for the 'std' namespace.

/'bsls_nullptr'
/ - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_nullptr'} component provides a limited emulation of the C++11 type,
 'std::nullptr_t', which can be used as a function parameter type to create an
 overload set where null pointer literals are handled specially.

/'bsls_objectbuffer'
/- - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_objectbuffer'} component provides a templated buffer type,
 'bsls_ObjectBuffer', which is compile-time sized and aligned to hold a
 specified object type.  Defining a 'bsls_ObjectBuffer<T>' object does not
 cause the constructor for 'T' to be called.  Similarly, destroying the object
 buffer does not call the destructor for 'T'.  Typically, a 'bsls_ObjectBuffer'
 is used in situations where efficient (e.g., stack-based) storage is required
 but where straightforward initialization or destruction of an object is not
 possible.  It can also be used to create a 'union' containing non-POD element
 types.

/'bsls_performancehint'
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_performancehint'} component provides performance hints for the
 compiler or hardware.

/'bsls_platform'
/- - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_platform'} component defines preprocessor macros that identify and
 describe platform-specific attributes (at compile time).  These attributes
 consist of the types and versions of operating system, processor(s), and
 compiler that comprise the platform.

/'bsls_platformutil'
/- - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_platformutil'} component provides a namespace for a collection of
 'typedef's and pure procedures that would otherwise have platform-dependent
 interfaces.  For example, it defines the preferred fundamental types denoting
 signed and unsigned 64-bit integers, the preferred integral type denoting a
 number of elements in allocators and containers, provides the capability of
 determining whether a machine is big or little endian across all supported
 platforms, and defines a set of macros replacing the standard 'htonl',
 'htons', 'ntohl', and 'ntohs' which do not require including any system
 header.

/'bsls_protocoltest'
/- - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_protocoltest'} component provides classes and macros for testing
 abstract protocols.

/'bsls_stopwatch'
/ - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_stopwatch'} component implements a real-time (system clock)
 interval timer.  A 'bsls_Stopwatch' object can accumulate and return only one
 interval at a time, but may be started and stopped repeatedly without being
 reset, so the elapsed time "interval" accumulated by a single object may be
 from multiple, discontinuous segments of time.  The non-negative total
 accumulated time (in seconds) is available as a 'double' value.

/'bsls_timeutil'
/- - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_timeutil'} component provides a set of platform-neutral pure
 procedures to access real-time system clock functionality.  High-resolution
 time functions intended for interval-timing return an interval in nanoseconds
 (1 nsec = 1E-9 sec) as a 64-bit integer.

/'bsls_types'
/ - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_types'} component provides a namespace for a set of 'typedef's that
 provide a stable, portable interface to platform-dependent types.

/'bsls_unspecifiedbool'
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bsls_unspecifiedbool'} component provides a class template that can be
 used to manufacture an "unspecified boolean type" that is distinct for each
 class that instantiates it.  *Not* for use outside the 'bsl' package.

/'bsls_util'
/- - - - - -
 The {'bsls_util'} component provides pure functions that supply essential
 low-level support for implementing portable generic facilities such as might
 be found the the C++ standard library.
