@PURPOSE: Provide annotation macros for BDE Users.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Annotations (bsla)

@AUTHOR: Andrew Paprocki (apaprock), Bill Chapman (bchapman2)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bsla' package provides a variety of macros that expand to
 annotations to provide hints to the compiler, to suppress or emit compiler
 warnings or errors.

 The annotations themselves are not supported on all compilers, and sometimes
 different annotations are required for different compilers to have a given
 effect.  The macros provided in this package either expand to the correct
 annotation for the current compiler, or, if the compiler does not support any
 form of the given annotation, the macros expand to nothing.

 For every macro 'BSLA_{X}', there is a corresponding macro
 'BSLA_{X}_IS_ACTIVE' which is always defined to an integer, and expands to 0
 if the 'BSLA_{X}' expands to nothing and 1 if 'BSLA_{X}' expands to an
 annotation and the annotation works.  There are situations where compilers
 will "tolerate" an annotation -- the annotation won't be reported as a syntax
 error, but it will have no effect: in those cases, 'BSLA_{X}' will expand to
 nothing and 'BSLA_{X}_IS_ACTIVE' will be 0.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bsls' package currently has 15 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to some of the components in the
 'bsls' package.  See the documentation in each component for full details.

/'bsla_annotations'
/ - - - - - - - - -
 This component exists to provide a single component whose header can be
 included to transitively include all of the annotation macros defined in the
 'bsla' package.  The macros that are transitively included by this component
 correspond to various compiler features, and can be used to annotate code for
 specific compile-time safety checks.

/'bsla_deprecated'
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that hints to the compile that a
 function, variable, or type is deprecated.

/'bsla_error'
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that flags a function such that a
 compiler error will occur when the function is called.  On platforms where the
 appropriate attribute is not supported, the macro expands to nothing.

/'bsla_fallthrough'
/- - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that suppresses compiler warnings
 about flow of control fall-through from one 'case' or 'default' of a 'switch'
 statement to another.  On compilers where the appropriate attribute is not
 supported, the macro expands to nothing.

/'bsla_format'
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro to indicate that an indexed
 argument of a function is a 'printf'-style format specification, and that the
 function will return a 'printf'-style format string with an equivalent
 specification.

/'bsla_nodiscard'
/- - - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that annotates a function such
 that a compiler warning will be generated if the return value of the function
 is ignored.

/'bsla_nonnullarg'
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component provides preprocessor macros that define compiler-specific
 compile-time annotations.  These macros instruct the compiler to warn if
 'NULL' is passed to certain arguments to a function, or, on platforms where
 the feature is not supported, expand to nothing.

/'bsla_noreturn'
/ - - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that annotates a function as
 never returning, resulting in a compiler warning if a path of control exists
 such that the function does return.

/'bsla_nullterminated'
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides preprocessor macros to indicate that a variadic
 function's arguments are terminated by a 'NULL' value, or, in the case of
 'BSLA_NULLTERMINATEDAT', by a 'NULL' value at a certain index.  Note that the
 terminating 'NULL' must actually be 'NULL'; passing 0 in it's place will
 result in a warning.

/'bsla_printf'
/- - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that allows the designation of a
 given function argument as a 'printf'-style format string, and arguments
 starting at a certain index in the argument list to be formatted according to
 that string.

/'bsla_scanf'
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that indicates that one of the
 arguments to a function is a 'scanf'-style format string, and that the
 arguments starting at a certain index are to be checked for compatibility with
 that format string.

/'bsla_unreachable'
/- - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that hints to the compile that a
 statement in the code is intended to be unreachable.

/'bsla_unused'
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that will suppress "unused"
 warnings on a locally defined function, type, or variable that is not used.

/'bsla_used'
/ - - - - -
 This component provides a preprocessor macro that will guarantee the emission
 of a local function, type, or variable whether it is used or not.

/'bsla_warning'
/ - - - - - - -
 This component provides a macro that indicates that a compiler warning should
 be emitted when a given function is called.
