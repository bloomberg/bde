@PURPOSE: Provide replacement classes (adopted from STLport) for STL.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library STlPort types (bslstp)

@AUTHOR: Arthur Chiu (achiu21)

@DESCRIPTION: This package mainly provides replacement classes, adopted from
 STLport, for STL constructs that required modification to (inter)operate with
 BDE libraries.  In addition to STL replacement classes, this package also
 provides helper components for the STL implementation classes.

 In general, the components in this package conform to the STL interface.
 However, the components (and hence the headers) are intended for private use
 only.  Clients should use the standard headers directly (e.g., include
 '<bsl_hash_map.h>' instead of '<bslstp_hashmap.h>').

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bslstp' package currently has 11 components having 3 levels of physical
 dependency.  The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the
 components.  The order of components within each level is not architecturally
 significant, just alphabetical.

  3. bslstp_hashmap
     bslstp_hashset

  2. bslstp_hashtable
     bslstp_slist
     bslstp_sstream

  1. bslstp_alloc
     bslstp_exalgorithm
     bslstp_exfunctional
     bslstp_iosfwd
     bslstp_iterator
     bslstp_slistbase
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'bslstp'.  For the sake
 of brevity, we sometimes blur the distinction between a component and the
 primary types that the component provides.  We remind the reader that, in
 general, the distinction between a component and a class is important.

..
  'bslstp_alloc'        - allocator-related traits and container base adapter
  'bslstp_exalgorithm'  - STLport algorithm extensions
  'bslstp_exfunctional' - STLport functional extensions
  'bslstp_hashmap'      - SGI extension of a hash table and multi-hash table
  'bslstp_hashset'      - SGI extension of a hash set and multi-hash set
  'bslstp_hashtable'    - generic hash table used to implement 'hashmap' and
                          'hashset'
  'bslstp_iosfwd'       - forward declaration of stream classes that use
                          'bsl::allocator'
  'bslstp_iterator'     - iterator-related traits
  'bslstp_slist'        - SGI extension of a singly-linked list
  'bslstp_slistbase'    - helper class for implementation of 'slist'
  'bslstp_sstream'      - conforming 'std::sstream' implementation
