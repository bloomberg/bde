/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section a brief introduction to the packages of the 'bbl' package group.
 See the respective Package Level documents for more details.

/'bbldc'
/- - - -
 The {'bbldc'} package provides day-count convention implementations, an
 enumeration-based set of dispatch components, and two abstract interfaces with
 parameterized adapters for the day-count convention implementations.

/'bblscm'
/ - - - -
 The {'bblscm'} package contains only two components, 'bblscm_version' and
 'bblscm_versiontag'.  The first of these components is included by every other
 component in 'bbl', and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the 'bblscm_version' facilities to query a particular 'bbl'
 library for its version information.  The second component defines macros that
 can be used for conditional-compilation based on 'bbl' version information.
