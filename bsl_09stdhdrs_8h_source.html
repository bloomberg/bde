@PURPOSE: Provide a compatibility layer to enable BDE-STL mode in Bloomberg.

@LAST_MODIFIED: Mar 1, 2010

@DESCRIPTION: The &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; package provides a compatibility layer for
 BDE-STL mode used by Bloomberg-managed code.  This document describes the
 contents of the &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; package, and also the design decisions and basic
 structure of the hybrid &#39;bsl&#39; mechanism.  Note that this package has *no*
 components, only headers.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; is a non-standard package containing all C++ standard header
 files and four additional headers used to facilitate the compatibility layer
 logic:
..
  2. all standard C++ headers

  1. bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue.h
     bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue_recursive.h
     bsl_stdhdrs_incpaths.h
     bsl_stdhdrs_prologue.h
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
: &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_prologue.h&#39;:
:     Provides the setup needed before including a native STL header.
:
: &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue.h&#39;:
:     Provides the clean up needed after including a native STL header.
:
: &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue_recursive.h&#39;:
:    Provides the recursive part of &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue.h&#39;.
:
: &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_incpaths.h&#39;:
:    Provides macros for relative paths to native STL headers.
:

A majority of the other headers of this package provide the functionality
of the corresponding C++ Standard headers. In addition, there are a set of
POSIX standard headers (most of which simply forward to the platform&#39;s
supplied header):
:   o &#39;assert.h&#39;
:   o &#39;ctype.h&#39;
:   o &#39;errno.h&#39;
:   o &#39;float.h&#39;
:   o &#39;iso646.h&#39;
:   o &#39;limits.h&#39;
:   o &#39;locale.h&#39;
:   o &#39;math.h&#39;
:   o &#39;pthread.h&#39;
:   o &#39;setjmp.h&#39;
:   o &#39;signal.h&#39;
:   o &#39;stdarg.h&#39;
:   o &#39;stddef.h&#39;
:   o &#39;stdio.h&#39;
:   o &#39;stdlib.h&#39;
:   o &#39;string.h&#39;
:   o &#39;time.h&#39;
:   o &#39;wchar.h&#39;
:   o &#39;wctype.h&#39;

/Supported Modes
/---------------
 In this document, different &quot;modes&quot; refer to the different meanings of
 &#39;std::*&#39; in source code.  Users can compile their code in two different modes:
: o Native-STL mode and
: o BDE-STL mode.
 In Native-STL mode, &#39;std::*&#39; is resolved to the standard libraries implemented
 by compiler vendors in the &#39;std&#39; namespace.  In BDE-STL mode, &#39;std::*&#39; is
 resolved to the standard libraries implemented by Bloomberg in the &#39;bsl&#39;
 namespace.

 One of the two STL modes is selected at compile time via a pre-processor macro
 definition: &#39;BSL_OVERRIDES_STD&#39;.  The default is Native-STL mode, which is
 selected when the macro is *not* defined.  When the macro is defined, BDE-STL
 mode is selected.

 The following sections provide more information on the two modes.

/Native-STL Mode
/- - - - - - - -
 In Native-STL mode, users that include standard headers, such as &#39;&lt;vector&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;&lt;algorithm&gt;&#39;, &#39;&lt;string&gt;&#39;, etc., will include the native (i.e., compiler
 vendor supplied) implementation of the standard library in the &#39;std&#39;
 namespace.  Users that include Bloomberg-provided STL headers such as
 &#39;&lt;bsl_vector.h&gt;&#39;, &#39;&lt;bsl_algorithm.h&gt;&#39;, &#39;&lt;bsl_string.h&gt;&#39;, etc., will include
 Bloomberg&#39;s implementation of the standard library in the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace.

 The &#39;bsl&#39; namespace introduced in the &#39;bsl_*.h&#39; headers makes available a full
 implementation of the standard library.  Bloomberg provides its own
 implementation for all containers, &#39;pair&#39;, and &#39;stringstream&#39;, while other
 parts of the standard library (such as other streams, algorithms, locales) are
 introduced to the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace via aliases to the compiler&#39;s native
 implementation.

 Bloomberg currently provides its own implementation for eighteen class
 templates:
..
  vector    pair(*)     map             unordered_set
  string    set         priority_queue  unordered_multimap
  deque     multiset    bitset          unordered_multiset
  list      multimap    stringstream
  queue     stack       unordered_map
..

 (*) Note that Bloomberg provides an implementation of &#39;pair&#39;, but not
 &#39;make_pair&#39;.  &#39;bsl::make_pair&#39; refers to the native compiler-supplied
 implementation of &#39;make_pair&#39;.  (The rationale of this design decision can be
 found in the implementation file of &#39;bslstl_pair&#39;.)

/BDE-STL Mode
/ - - - - - -
 In BDE-STL mode, the namespace &#39;std&#39; is equivalent to &#39;bsl&#39;.  Users explicitly
 using &#39;std::&#39; to qualify standard library components will still be using
 Bloomberg&#39;s implementations for all containers, &#39;pair&#39; and &#39;stringstream&#39;.

 Furthermore, including either the standard STL headers (e.g., &#39;&lt;vector&gt;&#39;) or
 the corresponding &#39;bsl_*.h&#39; headers (e.g., &#39;bsl_vector.h&#39;) will pull in the
 same implementation, which can be access via either &#39;std::&#39; (e.g.,
 &#39;std::vector&#39;) or &#39;bsl::&#39; (e.g., &#39;bsl::vector&#39;).

/Interoperability
/----------------
 When developing code for Bloomberg production, it is usually appropriate to
 code and build in BDE-STL mode, so that all code can interoperate using the
 enhanced BDE STL types.  In this case, BDE STL simply replaces native STL
 entirely.

 When developers need to compile and link against third-party software that
 requires the use of compiler vendor supplied standard library implementation,
 it might be necessary to interoperate with the native types directly, even
 while taking advantage of BDE STL types elsewhere in the code.  In these
 cases, Native-STL mode is appropriate.

 The following diagram illustrates what needs to be done to compile against
 source code and link against libraries that use the compiler vendor supplied
 standard library implementation:
..
             .------------.                    .------------.
             |            |   interoperate     |            |
           .-------------.|  &lt;------------&gt;  .-------------.|
           | third-party ||                  | Bloomberg   ||
           |  libs &amp; .h  |                   |  libs &amp; .h  |
           |_____________|                   |_____________|

                 (1)                             (2)
..

: 1 Libraries should already be compiled, headers should include standard STL
:   headers, and source code should use &#39;std::&#39; when referring to the standard
:   library components.
:
: 2 Libraries should be compiled in Native-STL mode, headers should include
:   Bloomberg&#39;s STL headers, and source code should use &#39;bsl::&#39; when referring
:   to Bloomberg&#39;s implementation of standard library components.  If the
:   Bloomberg library needs to pass a standard library object to the
:   third-party library, the standard library object needs to be converted to
:   the compiler vendor supplied version first (e.g., &#39;bsl::vector&#39; needs to be
:   converted to &#39;std::vector&#39; first since these are different types under
:   Native-STL mode) before passing the object through.

 Note that the &#39;bsl&#39; package group itself is built in native STL mode (i.e.,
 &#39;BSL_OVERRIDES_STD&#39; is *not* defined).  &#39;bsl&#39; needs to use &#39;bslstl&#39; headers,
 and they are not designed to be included directly in &#39;BSL_OVERRIDES_STD&#39; mode.

 The rest of this document is intended to explain the design and record the
 reasons for design decisions made during the development of the hybrid bsl
 mechanism.  Readers who are interested only in how to use this mechanism can
 stop here.

/Hierarchical Structure of Hybrid &#39;bsl&#39; Mechanism
/----------------------------------------------

/bslstl
/ - - -
 &#39;bslstl&#39; contains Bloomberg&#39;s implementation of allocators and STL containers.

/bsl+bslhdrs
/- - - - - -
 &#39;bsl+bslhdrs&#39; contains all the &#39;bsl_*&#39; headers (corresponding to standard STL
 headers, e.g., &#39;&lt;bsl_string.h&gt;&#39; for &#39;&lt;string&gt;&#39;).  When included, the files in
 this directory inject native STL symbols from the &#39;std&#39; namespace into the
 &#39;bsl&#39; namespace, or include the corresponding &#39;Bloomberg&#39; type.

/bsl+stdhdrs
/- - - - - -
 &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; contains all the headers used to intercept the inclusion of
 standard STL headers.  This directory also contains auxiliary files that
 implement pre-processor logic to support BDE-STL mode, such as
 &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_prologue.h&#39; and &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue.h&#39;.

 Note that when users compile under Native-STL mode, the headers in
 &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; are not necessary (though no harm when included).

/Understanding the Files in &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;
/----------------------------------------
 The headers in &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; are intended to replace standard STL headers, and
 contain complex preprocessor logic to support BDE-STL mode.  These headers
 have evolved from what started as a simple set of headers.  For example:
..
  // bsl+stdhdrs/iterator
  // ...

  #ifndef INCLUDED_ITERATOR
  #define INCLUDED_ITERATOR

  #ifdef std
  #undef std
  #endif

  #ifndef INCLUDED_NATIVE_ITERATOR
  #include &lt;../native/iterator&gt;
  #define INCLUDED_NATIVE_ITERATOR
  #endif

  #ifdef BSL_OVERRIDES_STD
  #define std bsl
  #endif

  #include &lt;bsl_iterator.h&gt;

  #endif
..
 where
..
  // bsl+bslhdrs/bsl_iterator.h
  // ...

  #ifndef INCLUDED_BSL_ITERATOR
  #define INCLUDED_BSL_ITERATOR

  #ifndef INCLUDED_ITERATOR
  #include &lt;iterator&gt;
  #endif

  namespace bsl {
    using ...;  // put symbols in bsl
  }

  #include &lt;bslstl_iterator.h&gt;  // our implementation

  #endif
..
 The &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; file above would first include the native compiler&#39;s
 implementation of iterator using a relative path (to avoid including itself
 again since direct inclusion of &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; is intercepted).  Then, it will
 rely on &#39;&lt;bsl_iterator.h&gt;&#39; to inject the symbols (if any) defined in the &#39;std&#39;
 namespace in the native iterator into the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace, and also include
 BDE&#39;s implementation of iterator (&#39;&lt;bslstl_iterator.h&gt;&#39;).  The file also
 &#39;#define&#39;s &#39;std&#39; to &#39;bsl&#39; such that when users type &#39;std::iterator&#39;, the
 pre-processor will silently change the qualified name to &#39;bsl::iterator&#39;.  The
 &#39;#define&#39; must be done after the inclusion of the native header, since native
 STL code must be able to refer to &#39;std&#39; directly.  For the same reason, a
 &#39;#undef&#39; of &#39;std&#39; is necessary before the inclusion of the native
 &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39;.

 The &#39;&lt;bsl_iterator.h&gt;&#39; file injects the symbols (if any) defined in the &#39;std&#39;
 namespace in the native iterator into the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace.  Before the series
 of &#39;using&#39; directives, the native &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; must be included.  The
 inclusion is done by directly including &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; (i.e., not using any
 relative paths).  In Native-STL mode, the compiler-provided &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39;
 header is included.  In BDE-STL mode, the &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; provided in
 &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39; is included, which will then bring in the compiler vendor
 supplied &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39;.  Then a series of &#39;using&#39; directives inject needed
 symbols (if any) defined in the &#39;std&#39; namespace into the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace.
 Finally, BDE&#39;s implementation of iterator (&#39;&lt;bslstl_iterator.h&gt;&#39;) is included.

 There are several problems with this approach.  First of all, simply including
 our implementation directly after including the native header could introduce
 cycles into the native STL&#39;s carefully crafted include graph.  The problem is
 that we do not have access to the private implementation headers that the
 compiler-provided STL implementation uses to eliminate these cycles.  An
 include chain illustrating the breakage might be as follows (note that this
 would happen only in BDE-STL mode):
..
  locale
    bsl_locale.h
      native_locale
        string
          bsl_string.h
            native_string
              bslstl_string.h
                iterator
                  bsl_iterator.h
                    native_iterator
                      native_ostream      // simplified, skipped bsl_* versions
                        native_streambuf  // compilation error in this header
                          native_locale
..
 At this point, it appears to &#39;native_streambuf&#39; that &#39;locale&#39; was already
 included (due to include guards introduced when &#39;native_locale&#39; is first
 brought in), and may start using symbols that haven&#39;t been defined.

 The compiler&#39;s &#39;string&#39; header generally just includes the private
 implementation file of iterator (e.g., &#39;rw_iterator&#39; or &#39;iterator_base&#39;),
 which does not include &#39;ostream&#39;, hence eliminating this problem from the
 compiler-provided standard library.  Since we don&#39;t have access to those
 private implementation files, we cannot resolve the problem the same way.

 The original solution was to add the following logic to the headers defined in
 &#39;bsl+stdhdrs&#39;:
..
  #ifndef TOPLEVEL
  #define TOPLEVEL
  #define TOPLEVEL_BY_ITERATOR
  #endif

  // include native &#39;iterator&#39;, &#39;#defines&#39;, etc.

  #ifdef TOPLEVEL_BY_ITERATOR
  #include &lt;bsl_iterator.h&gt;
  #undef TOPLEVEL_BY_ITERATOR
  #undef TOPLEVEL
  #endif
..
 This approach ensures that our implementation file gets introduced only after
 the native header finished including all other native header files it needed;
 however, doing so would mean that none of our implementations will get pulled
 in except for the one defined in the &quot;top-level&quot; file (e.g.,
 &#39;&lt;bsl_iterator.h&gt;&#39;), which causes another problem: On the Sun compiler, after
 a standard-named header is included once, it will never be included again.  To
 see why this problem occurred, suppose we have the following includes in
 BDE-STL mode:
..
  #include &lt;iterator&gt;
  #include &lt;string&gt;
..
 Including &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39; will include the native iterator, which in turn pulls
 in the native string.  At the end of the include of &#39;&lt;iterator&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;bsl_iterator.h&#39; will be included and the native symbols it includes will be
 injected into the &#39;bsl&#39; namespace via &#39;using&#39; directives.  However, since only
 our implementation file (corresponding to the top-level file, in this case,
 &#39;bsl_iterator.h&#39;) is pulled in, &#39;bsl_string.h&#39; will not be included, and
 Bloomberg&#39;s string implementation will not be pulled in.

 When a user includes &#39;&lt;string&gt;&#39;, the Sun compiler will recognize that
 &#39;&lt;string&gt;&#39; had already been included, and thus will skip the inclusion.
 Because of this &quot;optimization&quot;, Bloomberg&#39;s implementation of string will not
 be included, and subsequent code using &#39;string&#39; will fail to compile.

 Since standard headers are given only ONE chance of being included, we have to
 record all native headers that had been included and include our corresponding
 implementations when inclusion of all native headers finish.  Hence, an
 epilogue file (&#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue.h&#39;) was introduced to centralize the
 preprocessor logic that accomplishes the above post processing step.

 The epilogue file can recursively include itself (via
 &#39;bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue_recursive.h&#39;) to process all native headers
 independently of their dependencies on each other and independently of
 &#39;bslstl&#39; header dependencies on native headers.  (Recursion here is a
 preprocessor equivalent for a loop.)  By doing so, it guarantees that it
 finishes only when all native headers are matched with our corresponding
 implementations.

/Other Design Discussions
/------------------------
: o Some C header files are meant to be included multiple times, such as
:   &#39;time.h&#39;, &#39;math.h&#39;, etc.  These header files contain preprocessor logic
:   that brings in different section of the code depending on how the header is
:   included.  Therefore, the include guards in those files do not guard the
:   entire file.
:
: o &#39;.SUNWCCh&#39; files are needed to override the native STL include files when 
:   using the Oracle Studio compiler.  The file extension tells the compiler 
:   that it is an STL header file.
