@PURPOSE: Provide flexible, efficient management of message buffers.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Library Blobs (btlb)

@SEE_ALSO: bces, bcemt, bdema, bslma

@DESCRIPTION: This package defines, &#39;btlb::Blob&#39;, a vocabulary type for other
 &#39;btl&#39; packages.  A &#39;btlb::Blob&#39; object consists of a sequence of
 &#39;bltb::BlobBuffer&#39; objects, each of which have a shared pointer to underlying
 memory.  A protocol is defined for factories to manage &#39;bltb::BlobBuffer&#39;
 objects, and a concrete implementation is provided.  Other components define
 non-primitive operations on &#39;btlb::Blob&#39;s.
