//@PURPOSE: Provide a mechanism to monitor the consumption rate of a resource.
//
//@CLASSES:
//   btls::LeakyBucket: a leaky bucket rate monitor
//
//@SEE_ALSO: btls_ratelimiter
//
//@DESCRIPTION This component provides a mechanism, &#39;btls::LeakyBucket&#39;, that
// implements a leaky bucket algorithm that allows clients to monitor whether a
// resource is being consumed at a particular rate.
//
// The name of this mechanism, leaky bucket, derives from an analogy of pouring
// water into a bucket with a hole at the bottom.  The maximum rate at which
// water will drain out the bucket depends on the size of the hole, and not on
// the rate at which water is poured into the bucket.  If more water is being
// poured into the bucket than being drained, the bucket will eventually
// overflow.  If the person pouring water into a leaky bucket ensures the
// bucket doesn&#39;t overflow, then the average rate they pour water will, over
// time, be limited by the rate at which water flows out of the bucket.  By
// analogy, a leaky bucket provides a means to limit the rate of consumption of
// some resource (water poured into the bucket) to a configured rate (the size
// of the hole in the bucket).
//
// The behavior of a leaky bucket is determined by two properties: the capacity
// and the drain rate.  The drain rate, measured in &#39;units/s&#39;, is the rate at
// which the resource is drained.  The capacity, measured in &#39;units&#39;, is the
// maximum amount of the resource that the leaky bucket can hold before it
// overflows.  &#39;unit&#39; is a generic unit of measurement (e.g., bytes, number of
// messages, packets, liters, clock cycles).  Note that the drain rate
// determines average rate of resource consumption, while the capacity
// restricts the time period over which the average actual rate of resource
// consumption approaches the drain rate.
//
///Adding Units
///------------
// Units can be added to a leaky bucket by either submitting them or reserving
// them.  Submitted units are removed from a leaky bucket at the drain rate,
// while reserved units remain unchanged until they are later either cancelled
// (removed from the leaky bucket) or submitted.
//
///Submitting Units
/// - - - - - - - -
// Units can be submitted to a leaky bucket by invoking the &#39;submit&#39; method,
// and should be added only after the resource had been consumed.
//
// Figure 1 illustrates a typical workflow for submitting units to a leaky
// bucket.
//..

// Time: t0          t0 + 4s        t0 + 4s       t0 + 10s
//..
// Suppose that we have an empty leaky bucket with a capacity of &#39;c = 5 units&#39;
// and a drain rate of &#39;d = 1 units/s&#39;.  At &#39;t0&#39;, we submit 5 units to the
// leaky bucket, bringing the total number of units held up to 5.  At
// &#39;t0 + 4s&#39;, 4 units have been drained from the leaky bucket, bringing the
// number of units held down to 1.  Finally, at &#39;t0 + 10s&#39;, all units have been
// drained from the leaky bucket, making it empty.
//
// Unlike a real-life water bucket, units submitted to a leaky bucket don&#39;t
// spillover after its capacity has been exceeded, instead the leaky bucket may
// hold a number of units beyond its capacity, as examined in Figure 2 below.,
// these units are still contained in the leaky bucket.
//
// Figure 2 illustrates what happens if a leaky bucket exceeds its capacity.
// This scenario is the same as that in Figure 1, but at time &#39;t0 + 4s&#39;, we
// submit 6 units instead of 2.
//..
// Fig. 2: Capacity = 5 units, Rate = 1 unit / second

//    Submit 5                     Submit 6

// Time: t0          t0 + 4s        t0 + 4s       t0 + 10s
//..
// At &#39;t0 + 4s&#39;, when the number of units held by the leaky bucket is 1, we
// submit 6 more units.  This brings the number of units held to 7, which
// exceeds the capacity of the leaky bucket.  At &#39;t0 + 10s&#39;, 6 units had been
// drained from the leaky bucket bring the number of units held down to 1.
//
///Reserving Units
///- - - - - - - -
// Units can be reserved for a leaky bucket using the &#39;reserve&#39; method, and
// they may be later canceled using the &#39;cancelReserved&#39; method or submitted
// using the &#39;submitReserved&#39; method.  Unlike submitted units, reserved units
// do *not* drain from the leaky bucket; like submitted units, reserved units
// count toward the total number of units for the purposes of determining
// whether a leaky bucket has exceeded its capacity.  Reserving units
// effectively decreases the capacity of a leaky bucket.  Therefore, the time
// interval between reserving units and submitting or canceling the reservation
// should be kept as short as possible.  For a practical example of using
// reserved units, please see &#39;btls_reservationguard&#39;.
//
// Figure 3 illustrate an example of how reserving units works in a leaky
// bucket.
//..

// and a drain rate of &#39;d = 1 units/s&#39;.  At &#39;t0&#39; we reserve 4 units.  At
// &#39;t0 + 5s&#39;, we observe that none of the reserved units are drained from the
// leaky bucket.  At &#39;t0 + 6s&#39;, we submit 3 of the previously reserved units,
// which brings the number of reserved units down to 1 and the number of units
// held up to 3.  At &#39;t0 + 9s&#39;, we observe that all but the remaining reserved
// unit have been drained from the bucket.  Finally, at &#39;t0 + 10s&#39;, we cancel
// the remaining reserved unit.
//
///Monitoring Resource Usage
///-------------------------
// The recommended usage of a leaky bucket is to first check whether 1 unit can
// be added without causing the leaky bucket to overflow, and if so, consume
// the desired amount of the resource.  Afterwards, submit the amount of
// consumed resource to the leaky bucket.
//
///Checking for Overflow
///- - - - - - - - - - -
// A leaky bucket can be queried whether submitting a 1 more unit would cause
// it to overflow via the &#39;wouldOverflow&#39; method.  This method facilitates the
// recommended usage of a leak bucket: check whether 1 more unit can be added
// without causing the leaky bucket to overflow, and if so, consume the desired
// amount of the resource (which may be more than 1).  Compared to the
// alternative -- checking whether the desired amount can be submitted without
// overflow -- this recommended usage may allow a limited spike in the rate of
// actual consumption when the leaky bucket is empty (which is often
// acceptable) but is able to sustain a long term average that is actually
// closer to the drain rate.
//
///Modeling a Network Connection
///-----------------------------
// The primary use case of leaky bucket is limiting the rate at which data is
// written on a network.  In this use case, the drain rate of the bucket
// corresponds to the *ideal* maximum transmission rate that the client wishes
// to enforce on their outgoing connection.  Clients may choose to provide a
// value related to the physical limitations of their network or any other
// arbitrary limit.  The function of a leaky bucket&#39;s capacity is to limit the
// time period over which the average actual transimission rate may exceed the
// configured drain rate of the leaky bucket (see &#39;Approximations&#39; section and
// &#39;Sliding Time-Window&#39; section).
//
///Approximations
///--------------
// Leaky bucket is modeled on a water bucket with a hole, but as a leaky bucket
// does not manage any resources, there are several approximations to this
// model:
//
//: 1 Units are submitted instantaneously to the leaky bucket, whereas the
//:   consumption of a resource occurs over time at a rate that depends on the
//:   nature and speed of the resource.
//:
//: 2 Leaky bucket simulates the consumption of a resource with a specified
//:   fixed drain rate, but the resource is actually consumed at different
//:   rates over time.  This approximation still guarantees that the actual
//:   consumption rate does not exceed the specified drain rate when amortized
//:   over some configured period of time (determined by the capacity and the
//:   drain rate of the bucket), but does not prevent the consumption rate from
//:   spiking above the drain rate for shorter periods of time (see &#39;Sliding
//:   Time-Window&#39; section).
//
///Sliding Time-Window
///-------------------
// One of the properties of the resource pattern created by using a lleaky
// bucket is an approximation of a sliding time window over which the average
// consumption rate is guaranteed to be less than the drain rate.  This time
// period can be calculated using the leaky bucket&#39;s capacity and drain rate,
// which can be conveniently performed using the &#39;calculateTimeWindow&#39; class
// method.
//
///Time Synchronization
///--------------------
// Leaky bucket does not utilize an internal timer, so timing must be handled
// manually.  Clients can specify an initial time interval for the leaky bucket
// at construction or using the &#39;reset&#39; method.  Whenever the number of units
// in a leaky bucket needs to be updated, clients must invoke the &#39;updateState&#39;
// method specifying the current time interval.  Since leaky bucket cares only
// about the elapsed time (not absolute time), the specified time intervals may
// be relative to any arbitrary time origin, though all of them must refer to
// the same origin.  For the sake of consistency, clients are encouraged to use
// the unix epoch time (such as the values returned by
// &#39;bdlt::CurrentTime::now&#39;).
//
///Usage
///-----
// This section illustrates the intended use of this component.
//
///Example 1: Controlling Network Traffic Generation
///-------------------------------------------------
// In some systems, data is processed faster than they are consumed by I/O
// interfaces.  This could lead to data loss due to the overflowing of the
// buffers where data is queued before being processed.  In other systems,
// generic resources are shared, and their consumption might need to be managed
// in order to guarantee quality-of-service (QOS).
//
// Suppose we have a network interface capable of transferring at a rate of
// 1024 byte/s and an application wants to transmit 5 KB (5120 bytes) of data
// over that network in 20 different 256-bytes data chunks.  We want to send
// data over this interface and want to ensure the transmission uses on average
// less than 50% of the available bandwidth, or 512 byte/s.  In this way, other
// clients can still reasonably send and receive data using the same network
// interface.
//
// Further suppose that we have a function, &#39;sendData&#39;, that transmits a
// specified data buffer over that network interface:
//..
//  bool sendData(const char *buffer, size_t dataSize)
//      // Send the specified &#39;buffer&#39; of the specified size &#39;dataSize&#39; through
//      // the network interface.  Return &#39;true&#39; if data was sent successfully,
//      // and &#39;false&#39; otherwise.
//  {
//      (void) buffer;
//      (void) dataSize;
//
//      // In our example we don`t deal with actual data sending, so we assume
//      // that the function sends data successfully and return true.
//      return true;
//  }
//..
// First, we create a leaky bucket having a drain rate of 512 bytes/s, a
// capacity of 2560 bytes, and a time origin set to the current time (as an
// interval from unix epoch).  Note that &#39;unit&#39;, the unit of measurement for
// leaky bucket, corresponds to &#39;byte&#39; in this example:
//..
//  bsls::Types::Uint64 rate     = 512;  // bytes/second
//  bsls::Types::Uint64 capacity = 2560; // bytes
//  bsls::TimeInterval  now      = bdlt::CurrentTime::now();
//  btls::LeakyBucket   bucket(rate, capacity, now);
//..
// Then, we define a data buffer to be sent, the size of each data chunk, and
// the total size of the data to transmit:
//..
//  char                buffer[5120];
//  unsigned int        chunkSize  = 256;             // in bytes
//  bsls::Types::Uint64 totalSize  = 20 * chunkSize;  // in bytes
//  bsls::Types::Uint64 dataSent   = 0;               // in bytes
//
//  // Load &#39;buffer&#39;...
//..
// Notice that, for the sake of brevity, we elide the loading of &#39;buffer&#39; with
// the data to be sent.
//
// Now, we send the chunks of data using a loop.  For each iteration, we check
// whether submitting another byte would cause the leaky bucket to overflow.
// If not, we send an additional chunk of data and submit the number of bytes
// sent to the leaky bucket.  Note that &#39;submit&#39; is invoked only after the data
// has been sent.
//..
//  char *data = buffer;
//  while (dataSent &lt; totalSize) {
//      now = bdlt::CurrentTime::now();
//      if (!bucket.wouldOverflow(now)) {
//          if (true == sendData(data, chunkSize)) {
//              data += chunkSize;
//              bucket.submit(chunkSize);
//              dataSent += chunkSize;
//          }
//      }
//..
// Finally, if submitting another byte will cause the leaky bucket to overflow,
// then we wait until the submission will be allowed by waiting for an amount
// time returned by the &#39;calculateTimeToSubmit&#39; method:
//..
//      else {
//          bsls::TimeInterval timeToSubmit =
//                                           bucket.calculateTimeToSubmit(now);
//
//          // Round up the number of microseconds.
//          bsls::Types::Uint64 uS = timeToSubmit.totalMicroseconds() +
//                               ((timeToSubmit.nanoseconds() % 1000) ? 1 : 0);
//          bslmt::ThreadUtil::microSleep(static_cast&lt;int&gt;(uS));
//      }
//  }
//..
// Notice that we wait by putting the thread into a sleep state instead of
// using busy-waiting to better optimize for multi-threaded applications.
